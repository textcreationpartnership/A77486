            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo things of great weight are handled in this Epiſtle; Firſt, the Apoſtle doth avouch and maintaine the truth and dignity of his Apoſtleſhip, and this is done in the two firſt Chapters. Secondly, the Apoſtle doth by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons confirme the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Iuſtification, to be, not by the conjoyned workes of the Law with Faith, but by Faith alone in Chriſt: and this is done in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter, and to the 13. verſe of the fift Chap. In theſe words
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114018:5"/> here ſet downe, the Apoſtle doth moſt ſharply taxe the folly and madneſſe of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> in that being freed from the yoke of the Law by CHRIST; they would againe ſubmit and ſubject themſelves unto it: and this is done by an argument of contraries, or by ſhewing the moſt unlike contrary conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and effect of the Law and of Faith; it is thus framed. It is a moſt fooliſh and abſurd thing, for the free and ingenuous to give themſelves or inthrall themſelves in bondage: But all that <hi>Beleeve in Christ,</hi> are manumitted and ſet free, but they that are and will be under the Law are ſlaves and bondmen: And this madneſſe was partly layd open before, by ſhewing that the Law was as a Priſon, chap. 3.23. <hi>Wee were kept under and ſhut up, &amp;c.</hi> By ſhewing that the Law is as a ſevere Schoole-maſter. That it is alſo as a tutor and guardian for ſuch as are in their minority; and therefore all thoſe that were or would be under the Law, they did offer themſelves to be detained in Priſon, and doe acknowledge themſelves ignorant and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that need to be ordered and nurtured with the ſharpe diſcipline of another: now who is ſo fond and fooliſh as to delight alway to be in this condition.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of the Apoſtles reaſon is not expreſſed and needs no declaration, as being plaine to reaſon and common ſenſe and experience. The ſecond part of the Argument hath prefixed to it, an indirect reproofe of this Ignorance, in the 21 verſe; as if hee ſhould have ſaid. It is a moſt fooliſh and raſh part for any man to bind himſelfe or to deſire to ſerve any Maſter, and not to know what wages or reward he ſhall have: Will yee ſerve the Law, are you ignorant what is the fruit or profit of it, or if you be, why doe you not enquire and you ſhall find, that it is the bondage of your ſelfe and your Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. So that herein is the naturall inconſiderations of us all detected, that we runne a head in the way of errour and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and never conſider what will follow of it, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit we ſhall get, as the Apoſtle elſe-where ſheweth, by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Romans,</hi> with the like queſtion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What fruit had you, &amp;c.</hi> After this preparative, there followes the juſt and ſufficient proofe of the truth of the ſecond part of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114018:5"/> reaſons in the 22 verſe. From the type of the family of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> for as the Son of a bond-woman is a ſervant and bound, ſo the Son of a free-woman is free: So the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Law, borne of the law of their Mother, a bond-woman, are ſervants: But the beleevers in Chriſt borne of the free-woman, are theſe. The firſt part of this type is fully layd downe in the 22, and 23 verſes: the tradition, or latter part in the 24, 25, and 26 verſes.</p>

One namely, <hi>Agar,</hi> a bond-maid; the other, to wit, <hi>Sara,</hi> a free-woman. Second difference is, from the procreating or begetting cauſes, the one is of and by the fleſh; the other is of and by the Promiſe: and thus have you the parts and diviſion of the firſt part of the Text, of which in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

Whence ariſeth this obſervation: That the ſenſe and collection of the Scripture, is rightly called Scripture; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſenſe is not in expreſſe &amp; intire terms, any where: and this is oft uſed in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> This is to be noted againſt <hi>Arius Sabellius</hi> and ſuch Hereticks, who when they did impugne the Divinity of CHRIST, and the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Perſons in the unity of Eſſence in the bleſſed Trinity, they did condemne the names and words of Eſſence, Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, Subſiſtance, Unity, Trinity, which were uſed of the ancient Fathers; to open theſe myſteries, they I ſay, accuſed them of Novelty and falſhood; becauſe not found expreſly in the Scripture. But by this place of <hi>Paul</hi> we learne that there is no need that every word and ſyllable be found in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo that if the reaſon thereof be manifeſt out of the true ſenſe of the Scripture, it is all one; as if it had been written:</p>

               <p>Secondly, hence we learne, what wee are to judge of the Sermons of Miniſters. It muſt needs be, that in Preaching, while they open the Doctrine and exhort, that they utter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words and ſentences, which in every ſyllable are not found in Scripture; yet while they ſpeake out of the true ſenſe of Scripture, all their words are the words of God: Neither is there hereby any way made for the Papiſts, to eſtabliſh their ſmoakie and reaſty traditions, who when they heare thoſe termes of Conſubſtantiall, Coeſſentiall, &amp;c. Thinke that they may by the like right, obtrude upon us their fooliſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions as authorized by Scripture; for herein as in all other things, they erre fondly; for though is be lawfull to deviſe new words, the ground and meaning whereof is manifeſt out of the Scripture, yet to coine names repugnant to Piety, or ſuch as through their ambiguity may bring the ſame in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is wicked and not to bee attempted.</p>
               <p>And thus much out of the words, <hi>is it not written.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> Now followes the common deſcription of the Sons. They were two, and both of <hi>Abraham:</hi> He had alſo ſix Sons by <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turah, Gen.</hi> 25.1, 2. But <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention only of thoſe, wherein God did principally ſhadow forth the condition of the Church. Now <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention of <hi>Abraham</hi> their common Father, that none might boaſt in the prerogative of the Fleſh, as it was an uſuall thing with the <hi>Jewes</hi> to boaſt of their Stock, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. But when <hi>Abraham</hi> had two Sons of ſuch differing conditions, to what purpoſe is it to boaſt of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, Piety is not propagated by birth, but infuſed by Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and therefore, leaſt any ſhould aſcribe holineſſe to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rather then to grace, God permits oft, that the Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the godly, to become wicked. As <hi>Cain</hi> of <hi>Adam, Cham</hi> of <hi>Noah, Iſmael</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp;c. So that its not enough to Piety and Grace; that one be borne of godly Parents, which thing doth illuſtrate the grace of God, in that hence it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that godlineſſe flowes alone from Gods grace, and not from any humane endeavour, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1.12. For when as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did ſo diligently apply and imploy himſelfe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing his Family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. It is likely, he left no means
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114018:6"/> unattempted, whereby his ſonne <hi>Iſmael</hi> might be inſtructed to Piety, he loving him ſo well, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18. Whence came it then, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was godly, and <hi>Iſmael</hi> prophane. Surely hence, that God hath mercy on whom hee will; neither doth Birth or humane endeavour profit any whit without the grace of God; for as in Trees, ſet and planted, in the which, the Husbandman beſtowes equall paines and care, yet God gives life and increaſe as ſeemes good to him. So in diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his graces, God doth ſelect out of men, in every reſpect, equall, ſuch as on whom hee beſtowes his mercy, paſſing by others.</p>

And thus much of the generall deſcription.</p>
               <p>In the particular deſcription of Sons; the firſt difference is of the Mothers and their conditions. For one of the Sons was born of a Maid, ſubject to the authority of her Miſtreſſe; for hee is a Servant, that may not live after his owne will, but doth ſerve at the appointment and pleaſure of another; And hence note, that when in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time and family, there were ſuch Servants: It muſt needs be, that this condition and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114018:7"/> outward difference is both ancient and lawfull; otherewiſe, this holy man would not have ſuffered it in his Family,</p>
               <p>Now who and what manner of Servant this was here mentioned, nothing is mentioned in this place; but <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.1. ſhee is deſcribed by her Nation and name. She was an Egyptian; for it is likely, that while <hi>Abraham</hi> was driven by the famine into Egypt, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 12.8.9.) hee did with his money purchaſe this Maid; for men for the moſt part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſervants of ſtrange Countries as is to be ſeene of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> advanced by <hi>Pharoah,</hi> in <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervant: divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Scripture, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> waited on <hi>Aſhueroſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this womans name, it was <hi>Agar,</hi> this as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was impoſed on her by <hi>Abraham</hi> or his Family, and it ſignifies ſo much as that Stranger. So then we ſee what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of one the Mother of the one Son was: to wit, a Servant, an <hi>Egyptian</hi> by Nation, a ſtranger by her Name. But what is this to the Son? Namely this, To ſhew her Son to bee a Servant, as the Proverbe is; The brat or brood followes the Belly. But you will ſay, It was ſhewed before, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Parents, neither helps nor hurts the Of-ſpring. To this the anſwer is; It is true, in regard of the grace of God, but not as touching Externall and civill condition; for in this regard, ſuch Parents ſuch Children.</p>
               <p>Now this Externall condition of theſe Sons, God doth not make the cauſe of beſtowing or with-holding his Grace; but onely a figure and type thereof. But why is the ſonne of the Servant, firſt mentioned. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, becauſe hee was the elder. Second, becauſe for the moſt part, the condition of the ſonnes of this world, in carnall things, is better then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; they take to themſelves, lofty tytles, as the Son of the ſervant was called <hi>Iſhmaell,</hi> one heard of God: But the Son of the free-woman called <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Laughter; not onely of the laughter of his Parents, but becauſe he was laughed at and ſcorned of <hi>Iſmaell;</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> calls Perſecuting in the 28 verſe: againe, <hi>Iſmaell</hi> grew preſently into a mighty and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Nation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.20. and 25. chap. 11.12 verſ. But <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> ſcarce crept up in many ages; but ſuch is the will of God,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114018:7"/> who hath layd up better things for his, leaſt being faſtned to the earth, they ſhould forget heaven.</p>
               <p>The other Son was of the free-woman, of <hi>Sara,</hi> a wife, no captive, nor bought with money, and no way of Servile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but Free, the neice of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and this is the firſt difference of theſe two Sons, ariſing of the differing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Mothers.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference is, in regard of the manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; the Son of the ſervant is ſayd to be borne after the Fleſh, that is, after the ordinary courſe of Nature, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny word of God going before to that end. Secondly, hee is ſaid to be borne after the Fleſh, becauſe hee was begot and borne by the counſell of the fleſh; which <hi>Sara</hi> ſuggeſted to <hi>Abraham:</hi> For when they had received from God a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a Son, and had long expected the ſame, till growing in yeares, ſhee thought it vaine to expect it any longer of her ſelfe; ſhe thought it might be, that what God had Promiſed, hee would performe by another, and ſo out of the deſire of ſeed, ſhee perſwaded her Husband to goe in into her Maid: This counſell was of the Fleſh, and therefore that that was borne of it, is ſaid to bee borne after the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>This practiſe though it did argue great Humility and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in <hi>Sara,</hi> in not envying that honour to her Maid which ſhe thought was denyed to her ſelfe; yet herein great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee blamed, becauſe ſhe ought not by her owne over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſty deſire to have prevented the Lords opportunity; and therefore this her fact doth openly declare our corruption: which can not beare any long delay, but through irkſomneſſe wee are ready to attempt by unlawfull meanes, ſuch things as God would have effected by himſelf in ſeaſonable time: neyther was <hi>Abraham</hi> blameleſſe in this, that hee did ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily hearken to his wife adviſing ſo ill. But ſuch is our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: thus did the Children of <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19.32. Thus the Iſraelites, not expecting till <hi>Moſes</hi> returned (<hi>Exod.</hi> 32.) made the Calfe: Thus did <hi>Saul</hi> in preſuming to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.8, 9.) And in conſulting with the Witch, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.7.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> This muſt teach us to take notice of this Corruption, ſo watch over it that wee faint not in Faith; if God at any time deferre to performe his Promiſe, that we be not carried to the ſeeking of carnall and unlawfull means for the accompliſhing of it, but that in Faith and Patience wee poſſeſſe our ſoules; depending on him, who is faithfull, able and moſt wiſe to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect every thing in due ſeaſon. The want of this, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of in the <hi>Iſraelites, Pſal.</hi> 78.41. That the limited the holy one of Iſraell.

               </p>
               <p>A ſecond thing to bee obſerved hence, is, That albeit <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> was begot by holy Counſell in regard of the parties gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, and in regard of the end, why given; yet becauſe he was conceived without the authority of Gods word, hee is ſaid to be born after the Fleſh. <hi>Abraham</hi> was not moved by luſt but by his wives perſwaſion: If yet for all this, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth taxe this as a carnall Birth; then of what account, ſhall that unbridled luſt be had, to the fulfilling whereof men are caried with the breach of all the barres and bonds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, modeſty, and the ordinance of God. Sure the damnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Child ſo borne, ſhould bee of greater force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine, then the gaine got by ſuch filthy pleaſure, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke; for (though God being bound to none, can and doth freely beſtow his mercy, where ſeemes him good) yet as much as in us lies; that which is borne by ſuch conception, is made altogether Carnall. Not onely opprobious in regard of civill condition and diſhoneſty of birth, (then which, what injury can be greater) but is alſo made naked and deſtitute of divine Grace; which conſideration of it might take place, would be an effectuall bridle to this raging and raigning ſin of Luſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this is ſo, that this action and the fruit thereof in ſome ſort holy, is termed carnall, let us take heed of good intents; it is the Divels ſubtilty to corrupt our good wee doe by doing it oft to bad ends, and to encourage us to doe evill by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good ends, but both theſe are diſpleaſing to God. Good
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114018:8"/> intents then though never ſo holy, yet being beſides the word, are taxed and are unlawfull and dangerous; as are ſeene in the examples of <hi>Saul.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. In ſacrificing. See what a goodly end he had, verſe 11. and 12. ſo 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. They were reſerved for Sacrifices. So 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. beginning. <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew the <hi>Gibeonite</hi> forzeale to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yet a Plague came on the Land for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Second, It behoves us to watch over our hearts, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the thoughts and ſuggeſtions thereof, that they ſavour not too rankly of the fleſh; for even this counſell heere cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Carnall, had not his ground meerly on the fleſh, but in part of that faith which ſhe had in the Promiſe of God. So ſubtile is the divell (ſayes learned <hi>Beza</hi>) that he can ſerve his own turn, not onely, of our corruptions, but even of God graces in his Children, as here, and the like in <hi>Rebecca,</hi> who grounded on the Promiſe of God made her; that the elder ſhould ſerve the younger, was enduced to practiſe the accompliſhment of it by unlawfull and unſeaſonable meanes, to the endangering of her Son <hi>Iacob,</hi> and to the obſcuring of the wiſdome and truth of God, which elſe would have appeared more glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effected by God himſelfe. Thus much of the firſt Son and his condition.</p>
               <p>The other Son was born of the free-woman by Promiſe, not but that he was conceived and born of Man and Woman, but it is ſo ſaid; becauſe their barren and out-worne bodies were made able by vertue of the Promiſe to beget that Son. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. For in the begetting of this ſeed, there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then the naked ſtrength of nature; to wit, a word of Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19. God before had Promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> a numerous ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.16. But he neither told of whom hee ſhould conceive that Seed, nor what manner it ſhould bee: But in the word of Promiſe, by whoſe vertue <hi>Iſaac</hi> was conceived, every thing is determined diſtinctl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, as that <hi>Sara</hi> his wife ſhould be the Mother, the Seed ſhould be maſculine, a Man. His name <hi>Jſaac,</hi> and his condition, a confederate with God.</p>
               <p>Hence wee may obſerve two things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. That there is a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114018:9"/> certain difference of men as touching Gods grace, before they are bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                  </gap>ere, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> takes away this cavil. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> and the Type following here. It is not in the Parents power to conſtitute this difference of their Children. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, according to which, they beget Children of the Promiſe, is made unto them of God they make it not themſelves. Neither is it in the power of the Children borne, that at their own pleaſure, they can make themſelves Sons of the fleſh, or of the Promiſe; For how can that be left entire to them, that went before their being and beginning: So then it is in the power of God alone, who for his infinite goodneſſe and Iuſtice, and Soveraignty doe chuſe moſt freely on whom hee will have mercy as is plainly taught. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> This teaches, that the Grace which God vouchſafes his Children is moſt free. And therefore moſt obliged unto him in unſpeakable manner: For by nature, what was <hi>Iſaac</hi> above <hi>Iſmael,</hi> or <hi>Iacob</hi> above <hi>Eſau,</hi> as God himſelfe in upbraiding manner for their unthankfulneſſe, witneſſes againſt the <hi>Jewes. Malachi</hi> 1.2, 3. Was not <hi>Eſau Iacobs</hi> brother, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing hence to be learned is, what manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating of Children is pleaſing to God; to wit, that which is of his Promiſe. For here wee ſee, that this Son ſo born was enriched with all ſpirituall bleſſings, the other being paſt by. Firſt, that if any deſire a holy and bleſſed poſterity, he muſt ſeeke it by Promiſe. But you will ſay, there is no ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe extant now, as was then. J <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not as touching that particular kind of propagating the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and extraordinary raiſing of the Church; but there is a generall Promiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hath promiſed to bleſſe the lawfull and holy conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man and Wife, they then that goe a whoring after ſtrange fleſh, ſeeke ſtrange children, out of the Promiſe, which how heavy a thing it is, may eaſily be learned by thoſe, who have been borne after this manner.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 24. By the which thing, another thing is meant. J Wee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114018:9"/> have heard of the firſt part of this compariſon, now followes the latter to the ſpeciall application whereof, before he come, he doth admoniſh, that this Hiſtory which he hath rehearſed, doth containe more deepe matter, then it might ſeeme at the firſt view. But it doth not onely barely relate a thing done, but doth alſo ſhadow, and repreſent the condition of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Church. And therefore he ſayes, theſe are to be allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, which is, when one thing is ſignifyed by another, which is done two wayes; firſt in words, ſecond in actions, perſons or things. When one thing is ſaid in word and another is ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifyed, that is properly called an Allegory; for ſo the very word Allegory ſounds. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.13. Thou ſhalt tread on the Lyon and the Adder. <hi>Math</hi> 5.29.30. <hi>If thy eye offend thee, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are Allegoricall ſpeeches, by which another thing is meant, as is in other figurative ſpeeches. Second, when things are uſed whether dead or alive, brute or reaſonable, and that their perſons or actions are uſed to ſignifie another thing, then it is called a Type. So that in this place. This Anagogicall application of a thing done, is not properly an Allegory, (for that is only in figurative words) but it is ſo called in a large ſenſe, or abuſive manner as Rhetorick ſpeaks. For it is a Type indeed. For the houſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> was the true Church; and whatſoever in it, or in the ſucceeding old Church, when it was a Nation, did happen as memorable, were Types to us. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. Hence ariſes a double Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a reproofe, and that of two ſorts of men. Firſt, of thoſe, who from this place would fetch a patronage for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their wits, for while they doe moſt wickedly, corrupt the whole Scripture by their fooliſh A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>legories, ſeeking a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their error, they ſay the Apoſtle uſed Allegoricall application, which is falſe, for he onely uſed a Typicall: And ſuppoſe hee had done ſo, yet the uſe of it once or twice doth not infer a frequent and ordinary practice of it. Againe, theſe men do much ſwarve from the purpoſe of the Apoſtle; for an Allegory being another thing then that is ſaid, and that the whole Scripture ſhould be an Allegory, then it muſt needs be, that the ſenſe of Scripture cannot be that that the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114018:10"/> and ſo by Allegorizing, they take away all the literall ſenſe of Scripture, which for the moſt part, is the true ſenſe, but is not in an Allegory; now to do this is an intollerable wickedneſſe, farre from the Apoſtle; for he doth not weaken, much leſſe, deſtroy the credit and truth of the thing done, but out of the Hiſtory and literall ſenſe, as a ſhadow, doth deduce or extract a further truth ſignifyed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of men to be reproved hence, are ſuch, as do indeed abhorre Allegories. But yet do exerciſe great liberty in interpretation of Types, and wreſting them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for as every imprinted ſtampe and forme is proper to the Character by which it was ſtamped, and every ſhadow is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it own body: ſo every Type is an expreſſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſhadow of the patterne or truth to which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God; therefore it belongs not to us to coyn new and raſh interpretations at our liking, neither may we in this caſe compare or imitate the Apoſtle, who had drunk deeper of the Spirit, then we have done; and if any thing be darke to us, we muſt refraine our ſelves till God reveale it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be learned hence, is the agreement twixt the old and new Church, for when ſo many hundred yeares paſt things done in the old Church, are Types of ours now, it muſt needs be, that there is great conſent every where, for how can things better agree, then the Type and the thing ſignifyed by the Type, then the Seale and the ſtampe of the ſame; ſo that there is one and the ſame way to Salvation, one head, one Church, the ſame members, though diſtinguiſhed by times and places. But in this is our condition better then theirs, that they only ſaw the truth in the Type and ſhadow, wee in expreſſe feature, ſhape, and body. Which muſt teach us to be anſwerable in faith and manners; ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes performed, confirme us, and a thing done is eaſilier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved then that which is to be done. And ſo for our life, wee muſt expreſſe more obedience, and give more honour to our God, as more is looked for at the hands of one of diſcretion, then of a Child. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. at the beginning.</p>
               <p>Now followes the ſecond part of the compariſon it ſelfe.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114018:10"/> Which ſtands thus. As the two Mothers are to the two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo are the two Teſtaments to the worſhippers or embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers thereof.</p>
               <p>In this, two things is to be conſidered. 1. The fitting of the Type with the thing Typified, 2. The manner of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation or application. The application is two-fold, firſt, generall in theſe words. Theſe are the two Teſtaments, that is, theſe two Mothers are the two Teſtaments, the old and the new. But how can this be. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not in the thing it ſelfe or very deed, but in Type and ſignifycation; for as in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the earthly matter being a Symboll of the heavenly, is oft called by the name of it. As the Tree of life and of knowledge, of good and evill. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. The bloud of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices is called the bloud of the Covenant. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.26. The ſeaven fat Kine, are ſeaven plentifull yeeres, the Bread is the body of Chriſt, with infinite ſuch ſpeeches. So in this place, the two Mothers are the two Teſtaments, not that <hi>Agar</hi> or <hi>Sara</hi> were the Teſtaments themſelves, but becauſe they were the ſignes and Types thereof.</p>
               <p>Hence we learne, that as oft in Scripture as one thing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> called another, to conſider what is the reaſon thereof, and not to conclude thence, that the one is forthwith the other, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. Shall wee thence abſurdly conclude with the Papiſts, that the Bread and Wine are tranſubſtantiated, but wee muſt know that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake after Scripture manner, calling the ſigne by the name of the thing ſignifyed. Thus much of the generall.</p>
               <p>The particular Application is two-fold. Firſt of <hi>Agar,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Sara.</hi> In that of <hi>Agar,</hi> the applycation it ſelfe is in verſe 24. The manner of it in the 25. verſe, and it is on this wiſe. <hi>Agar</hi> ſignifies one Covenant and Teſtament, which was given on Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> which Covenant doth beget Children to bondage. Here two things to be conſidered. Firſt what Covenant is meant, ſecond what is the effect thereof. To wit, bondage.</p>
               <p>The Covenant is deſcribed from the place where it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Sina.</hi> Which what it was and the manner of it is ſet
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114018:11"/> down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22. chap. It was three-fold. 1. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, touching the inward ſervice of God and Eternall worſhip; The ſecond Ceremony concerning the outward manner of Gods worſhip, for the time, place, perſons and Sacrifices. The third was touching the Policy and Common-wealth of the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The effect of this Covenant, was ſervitude and bondage, and this was ſeene in two ſorts of people. Firſt in thoſe that knew how to uſe the Covenant, and were the true Sonnes of God, and beleevers, yet unto theſe, this Covenant was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy bondage, to be holden with ſo many prohibitions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſin was increaſed, to be cumbred with ſo many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies both coſtly and painfull; but eſpecially the Morall Law, was a great bondage to the Conſcience, making them to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>David</hi> trembled at the threats there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and in this regard <hi>the Law is truly called the Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to feare againe. Rom.</hi> 8.15. Hence the Law in regard of theſe, is called a <hi>Schoolemaſter, Gal.</hi> 3.24. And as long as one is under ſuch, he differs nothing from a ſervant, though he be Lord of all. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. at the beginning.</p>
               <p>The other ſort of men who are in the bondage of the Law, are thoſe, who knew not nor do not underſtand the right end and uſe of the Law, and ſo cleave to it, boaſt in this their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if by her right, they would claime the inheritance. It muſt needs be, that theſe men are moſt miſerable ſlaves. You will ſay how? <hi>Anſw.</hi> One is ſaid to be borne to ſervitude, to whom by right of birth, nothing is due, but if he deſire any liberty or dignity, he muſt purchaſe it by his own merits. So they that cleave to the Law &amp; ſeek not for ſalvation out of the ſame, they have no liberty nor inheritance purchaſed for them, but ſuch as they can get by their own deſerts. Now it is a hard ſervitude when the things commanded, exceed ſtrength, and it is a moſt hard and intollerable bondage to them, who for want of theſe things muſt undergoe the heavy wrath of God and torments of Eternall puniſhment, even for violating of an impoſſible command. Now by the Law, every Sonne of the Law is bound in his own perſon to performe all the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114018:11"/> things of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. For theſe comes wrath, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and theſe are impoſſible, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. Whence comes feare, terror, and diſpaire, when one ſees that he is excluded from all hope of Salvation by the ſame thing, by which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped once to obtain it.</p>
               <p>Hence we learne two things. Firſt, that the Law ſuffices no man to get the inheritance of Heaven, for this belongs to the Sonnes and free, not to Servants. Now the Sonnes of the Law are ſervants. Hence the <hi>Iewes</hi> by cleaving to the Law, &amp; not to <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, loſt the Inheritance. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8, 9. and 14. verſe. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1.12, 13, 14. verſ. And <hi>Paul</hi> twice beats on this, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> loſt Salvation becauſe they ſought it by the workes of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. So that wee muſt take heed, that we apply not our ſelves to the keeping of the Law with this hope, as the Papiſts and common people doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if the Law of God uttered from his own mouth, doth beget to bondage, then how great is their ſervitude that are held under the bondage and inventions of Antichriſt, who are tyed to Superſtitions, Faſts, Pilgrimages, numbred Prayers on Beads, lying on the ground, whippings. &amp;c. O miſerable ſoules! No tongue is able to expreſſe your miſery. And all praiſe to God and joy to us, in that God hath broken this yoake from of our ſhoulders, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9.3, 4, 5. The Papiſts uſe to boaſt that their followers do more devoutly give themſelves to the practice of good workes then wee do.</p>
               <p>What then? It may be, that a ſervant may uſe greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and paines then a Sonne; is his condition therefore better then the Sons, no: the obedience which is performed through feare, proceeds from love of it ſelfe: this which is done in love, doth come from the love of another, whom we love. Now whereas every man loves himſelfe more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it muſt needs be, that that be greater obedience (in outward ſhew) which comes from feare, then that is, which comes f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om love; but that greater obedience hath leſſe truth and ſolidity, then this leſſer; and therefore by this it cannot be rightly judged of men, it muſt be left alone to God. O that the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114018:12"/> Papiſts or ſeduced by them, would conſider what wrong they doe Chrſtians; for while they goe about to make them the Sons of God, they make them moſt fearefull bondmen, and preſcribe them ſuch a courſe that the longer they walke in it, the further from liberty: doe you ſo reward your followers, doe you ſo bleſſe your friends. And thus much of the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Now of the reaſon or manner of applycation, verſe 25. Why <hi>Agar</hi> doth reſemble the Law given in Mount <hi>Sina.</hi> This is for the great agreement that is twixt <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sina,</hi> and this agreement is ſeene in foure things. 1. In Name. 2. In the Place. 3. In the Married condition. 4. In the Servile.</p>
               <p>As touching the Name. I thinke the Greeke Fathers are here to be followed, <hi>Chryſoſtome, Oecumen, Theophilact,</hi> who ſay, that Mount <hi>Sina</hi> had two names; the one whereof was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> For theſe men, in regard of vicinity both of time and place, when and wherein they lived, might know theſe things better then we can doe: Againe, the Article <hi>To</hi> prefixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word <hi>Agar,</hi> being of the newter Gender, doth ſhew that the woman her ſelfe is not here underſtood, but the name; but the name was not a Type of the Mount or of the Law, but the woman herſelfe; and therefore the name is here taken, becauſe the name of the Mount was the ſame, as the Scripture ſeemes to teach. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.10. And other Authors, as <hi>Dion</hi> in <hi>Trajano,</hi> and <hi>Ziphilin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is the place of this Mount, whence is great agreement twixt <hi>Agar</hi> and the Mount, and ſo of the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered there. The Mount was in <hi>Arabia,</hi> out of the confines of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and what doth <hi>Agar</hi> ſignifie, but a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> as was ſhewed before; ſo that whether we reſpect the name it ſelfe, or the force of the Name, it might juſtly and fitly reſemble this Mount. Whence is manifeſt that God doth governe and diſpoſe the ſmalleſt things in the earth with great Counſell and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For what is more ſleighter, then the impoſing of a name, and yet we ſee here, that the names both of men and places are ſo wiſely ordered, that they are not raſhly impoſed, but ſo as may ſerve moſt fitly, both for his own providence, as alſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114018:12"/> for our Inſtruction, and the Law was given on this Mount, out of the bounds of the promiſed Land, that we might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that it was not the Law of our Country and of heyres, but of Exiles and baniſhed; whither alſo tended that, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> the Law-giver could not bring the people into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but <hi>Ioſhua</hi> did it, whom the Author to the <hi>Heb.</hi> calls <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And anſwers, to <hi>Ieruſalem that now is.</hi>] Here is touched the third argument, and it is as it were of conjugall condition, for as <hi>Agar</hi> was not the lawfull wife of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by her Miſtris into the fellowſhip of the marriage bed. (So this may ſeeme to be the meaning of the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, which in military uſe properly ſignifies, a Ranke in the Army, extended from the Fore-front to the rereward or hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.) So was <hi>Agar</hi> ſubordinate to <hi>Sara</hi> in the ſame ranke or order, but behind, in a more inferiour place and order, then was <hi>Sara;</hi> and ſo, as <hi>Agar</hi> ſubordinate to <hi>Sara</hi> was correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to her; ſo was <hi>Sina</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> For this Covenant that God made with the <hi>Jſraelites</hi> on <hi>Sina,</hi> is compared to a Marriage. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. For this Covenant of the Law was as the fellowſhip, <hi>Abraham</hi> had with <hi>Agar.</hi> But as this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant though ſhe was admitted into the fellowſhip of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed, yet was ſubject to her Miſtris, ſo is <hi>Sina</hi> inferiour to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to which God made a Promiſe of ſtraiter fellowſhip. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. This interpretation may ſhew ſtrange, and is new indeed, yet me thinks, it agrees moſt fitly with the purpoſe of this place.</p>
               <p>The fourth Agreement is, that as <hi>Agar</hi> with her ſons are in bondage, ſo is <hi>Sina</hi> with her Sons, and in this the <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that now is on the earth, is in bondage alſo, both bodily and ſpirituall. For firſt, they were in ſubjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and are now under the Tyranny and Superſtition of the Turke and Mahomet; neither was the Inhabitants of that place only in bondage, but all thoſe, whereſoever they dwell, which cleave to the Law. And thus much for theſe foure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular agreements of <hi>Sina</hi> and <hi>Agar,</hi> which are ſufficient to declare, that <hi>Agar</hi> was a Type of the Law.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 26. But <hi>Ieruſalem which is above, is free.]</hi> Here is the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114018:13"/> ſecond Application, of <hi>Sara</hi> to the other Teſtament, it ſtands thus: As <hi>Sara</hi> was to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſuch is the Church of the New Teſtament to the faithfull; and that the Text might runne more fully, ſome words may ſeeme needfull to be ſupplied, thus. But the other Mother, which is <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or is <hi>Sara,</hi> &amp;c. As in the Text,</p>
               <p>This Mother the Church is deſcribed by three things. Firſt, ſhe is above. 2. She is free. 3. A Mother of all beleevers. For the firſt, ſhe is ſaid to be above, firſt in way of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the other, &amp; that thereby their minds might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from thinking on the earthly <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> For as this was a Type of the other above, becauſe by the appointment of God, it had a Propitiatory, yet when the true one comes the ſhadow will vaniſh. And out of this firſt reſpect of this title, here fals to ground, the vaine boaſting and confidence of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in their earthly <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> for thoſe goodly and lofty Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophets of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did not concern the fleſh or the earthly <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> but in a Type. God is not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any place, though it hath been beautifyed by him with moſt ſingular bleſſings, and ſpeciall Promiſes. So then much more vaine is the bragging of the Papiſts of their <hi>Romiſh Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> which can ſhew no ſuch Promiſe as the earthly <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had, but only reſembles herin this, in a reducing and reviving all the dead and buried Ceremonies of the Synagogues.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Second, this <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is ſaid to be above, in regard of the Originall of it. Becauſe it hath it beginning from the Heavenly grace. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.13, 13. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3, 4. Every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber muſt be borne from above. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. The birth of thy womb is as the Morning dew, which comes from above, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60.21. The graft of my planting ſhall be the worke of my hands, that I may be glorifyed; hence it is. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. Wee are come to the Coeleſtiall <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>] From this ariſes this neceſſary and comfortable conſequence, that the Church is invincible, though Satan and the world plot the deſtruction of it never ſo much. For it cannot be that the planting of God ſhould be rooted up, and it cannot be that the earth ſhould be ſtronger then heaven, Man or Devill, then
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114018:13"/> God. Second, hence it followes that the Papiſts are no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this Church, or elſe Baſtards, for they will have part of the ſtrength of Nature, and Free-will; and not be borne whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Heaven; whereas this Church and every member of it is meerely from above, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not conceived by ſtrength of nature, but by the mighty power of God and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Third, this Church is ſaid to be above, for the common fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip it hath with the heavenly Kingdome of glory, whence <hi>Chriſt</hi> told <hi>Nathaniel, Iohn</hi> 1. at the end. That hence forth he ſhould ſee the heavens open, and the Angels aſcending and deſcending, this is that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23, 24. We are come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Angels; and to the Spirits of juſt men, and to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator, &amp;c. So that though the faithfull live here on earth, yet they have Communion with Chriſt. <hi>The way to the Holy of Holies, is now wide open.]</hi> This ſerves, Firſt to diſprove the Papiſts no true members of this Church, both becauſe their Doctrine is earthly, fixing mens minds to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things by them Doctrine of Images, Tranſubſtantiation, and all the manner of their worſhip; as alſo their lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Second, this ſerves much to ſtrengthen Gods children when we may certainly determine, that they that are the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church or earth, are and ſhall be members of the Church in glory.</p>
               <p>Third, our Converſation muſt be in heaven, not groveling on the earth, but our mind and meditation muſt be of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prepared, our heart and affections of love, joy, delight, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and hope muſt be fixed there, and thereby be made, to purge our ſelves. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. By out ſtedfaſt hope, doing the will of God in earth, as it is in heaven, as we Pray and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Property, is Freedome. Becauſe ſhe is freed from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If the Son make you free, you ſhall be free, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. at the end. Where the Spirit of the Lord is (as in the new Teſtament) there is liberty: And therefore, as <hi>Sara</hi> though for a while bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, yet becauſe the Wife and free, remained with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was partaker of the ſame dignity with him; when as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> becauſe a Servant, though fruitfull, was caſt forth. So the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> though barren of deſerts, yet becauſe a wife and free, whoſe dignity and worth is not to be meaſured by deſerts, ſhe ſhall be copartner of the heavenly Kingdome; whereas <hi>Agar</hi> puffed up with her carnall conception and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brood of workes, ſhall be excluded.</p>

Now there was never liberty coſt ſo deere as ours did, we are free, not to live as we liſt, but to him, that freed us. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. And it behooves us to look to it, for it had been better, never to have been freed then to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to be brought into bondage againe. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.20, 21, 22.

For this is not as the firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration where the Child is not ſenſible of it; but none have this, but they know it: True it is that the wonderfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working of it can not be conceived, no more then the wind can be ſeene, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5.6, 7. But yet it may be felt and diſcerned by the ſtirring and blaſt thereof. And every Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſhall find as great a difference in himſelfe, betwixt that bee was by Nature and now is by Grace, as a Child doth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114018:15"/> twixt the darke and ſtrait priſon of the Mothers wombe, and the world which is large and light. So then, many deceive themſelves, thinking they are Gods children, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came almoſt where the ſeed was ſowen, and never ſhew themſelves Spiritually alive by hungring after the milke of the Word; ſo that it may ranckle in the breſts of the Nurſes, before theſe will deſire to draw it out; and hence comes the neglect and contempt of the Word and Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Verſe 27. <hi>Rejoyce thou barren, &amp;c.]</hi> This is the reaſon of the Application out of the teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> chap. 54.1. And by allegation of this Scripture, it is manifeſt, that <hi>Sara</hi> was a lively patterne of the Evangelicall Church, and the Apoſtle warranted by Divine authority, did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the interpretation of this Type. For when the Prophet in theſe words alluding to <hi>Sara,</hi> doth ſpeake to the Chriſtian Church, it is meet that by the other, eyther Wife or Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the other Church ſhould bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; ſo that this Interpretation was not fained of himſelfe. For though the Apoſtles, of their own authority might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and command any thing to the Church, as being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the infallible aſſiſtance of the Spirit; yet oft did depart from ſome part of their right, and for the weaker ones, did confirme by Propheticall authority, what they did deliver, but this was touched before.</p>
               <p>This teſtimony doth ſhew a three-fold agreement twixt <hi>Sara</hi> and the Chriſtian Church: Firſt, in Sterility. Second, in joy for Of-ſpring. Third, in multitude of Poſterity. For the firſt, <hi>Sara</hi> was long barren, even till ſhe came to that age, that ſhe might diſpaire of Seed, but when ſhe had received a Promiſe of a Son, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then in progreſſe of time, the ſeed became ſo fruitf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll, that in multitude it farre paſſed the Poſterity of <hi>Agar,</hi> for the Iſmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites might not compare with the Iſraelites, eyther in large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Territory, or multitude of People. And even ſuch like was the ſtate of the Chriſtian Church before Chriſt, while
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114018:15"/> the Temple and Sinagogue flouriſhed, it was barren of any tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faithfull, and ſate as a widow forſaken, and ſo long remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thus, till all hope of ever being viſited with Of-ſpring might ſeeme to have been taken away. But when the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed came, how great joy and gladneſſe poſſeſſed the hearts of the faithfull, ſo that it was truly ſaid of the Angels. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. <hi>J bring you great tydings of joy;</hi> and now we ſee the Chriſtian Church farre to paſſe the Synagogue, that ſhee may now contend with her and overcome. Hence three things is to be learned. Firſt, that judgement is not to be given of a Churches truth or being, by the multitude of her Sons; for <hi>Agar</hi> was ever fruitfull, and <hi>Sara</hi> long barren, and the ſmall number of the Church is not to be deſpiſed, much leſſe to be forſaken. Why then doth <hi>Rome</hi> boaſt of her multitude, may ſhe not be <hi>Agar</hi> for all that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church doth rejoyce in the multitude of her Sons, that is, in the converſion of men to God, as the Angels do for a repentant ſinner. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4, 7, 9, 23. verſes.</p>

                  </label> The meditation of theſe points are very profitable. For firſt they admoniſh us of our former condition, what we were once; namely, barren and forſaken. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.10. This moſt diligently Saint <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſhes the <hi>Epheſians</hi> of, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 11, and 12 verſes. So doth <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 Epiſt. 2.9. &amp; 10. verſes. For hereby we ſhall be ſtirred up to thankfulneſſe and a walking worthy our calling, and a great meanes to keepe in obedience. To this end God appointed a ſervice to the <hi>Iewes, Deut.</hi> 26.5, 6. Wherein they ſhould ſolemnly remember their former condition. So did the Prophet <hi>Ezech.</hi> chap. 16.

No marvell if a Land be barren, that hath neither dew, Sunne, nor raine to refreſh it.

Every true Chriſtian muſt rejoyce in the proſperity of the Church, and grieve in the wayning and decay thereof, as Nature teaches to mourne in the loſſe or affliction of naturall brethren and ſiſters. So muſt grace in theſe of the godly; and the rather, becauſe Gods glory and the good of ſoules, ſhould be more deere and nere to us then any outward things: yea, this is a certain token to try our hearts by, if we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and mourne in the Peace and calamity of the Church, as in the naturall body, if one member be in paine, all ſuffer.</p>

So that the words read, doe containe a moſt paſſionate exclamation, and a bitter bewayling of thoſe horible evils and Calamities, that hangs over the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

An Inevitable calamity hanging over one, or approaching one, doth make his condition miſerable: But Scandals are inevitable and they draw with them miſery; and therefore the ſtate of the world thereby muſt needs be wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and wofull: The firſt part of the reaſon is appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

The ſecond part of the reaſon is in theſe words. <hi>It muſt needs be, that offences come.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion or laſt part is in the firſt words. <hi>Woe to the World.</hi> And in the laſt end of the verſe, is a ſecret objection anſwered. And now of the firſt words containing the concluſion or thing to be proved, the meaning wherof in generall is, that the world is miſerable through Offences; and here are three points to be handled. Firſt, what Scandals are, and the kinds of them. 2. The miſery comming by them. 3. The inevitableneſſe of them.</p>
               <p>The word here uſually tranſlated <hi>Offence,</hi> is not meant ſo much, ſin in it ſelf, as commonly they are called Offences, as they are indeed againſt both God and man. But the word <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> is here taken for a peculiar effect or fruit that followes on the evill behaviour of men; and therefore is well tranſlated Scandals, it being the <hi>Greeke</hi> word here uſed, and it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies that crooked peece of wood, to the which the baite in a Trap is faſtned, which while the Mouſe or other thing doth gnaw or move, it puls the Trap on it ſelf. It is alſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114018:17"/> any block that is caſt in ones way, wherby one may be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to ſtumble and fall, and ſo figuratively it is uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore this word is interpreted, by a departing as may appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e by comparing, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.21. With <hi>Luke,</hi> 8.13. For that which in the one place is called a <hi>Scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> in the other is called a <hi>Falling away:</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13. It is directly called a <hi>ſtumbling-blocke,</hi> whence a Scandall may be defined to be any word or deed, giving occaſion to any of falling into ſin, or of falling away from the received truth or practice of Piety, or doth cauſe a negligence in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Scandals are of two ſorts. Firſt, given. Second, taken. Scandals giuen, are all wicked ſayings, and deeds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning the loue of God and of our neighbour, and whereby the former effects are occaſioned, and theſe are either in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine, or in life and manners. Thus all falſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Doctrines, as of <hi>Iewes, Turkes, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> are great meanes whereby many are with-held from the right way to Salvation; but eſpecially the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are hereby a great ſcandall unto the <hi>Iewes</hi> who live among them; for they ſeeing Idols ſo uſuall in their Churches and Practices, which they juſtly abhorre; they are made thereby to loath Chriſtian Religion. Againe, all prophane and irreligious ſpeeches of God and his worſhip, are of this kind, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. All blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous contumelies and reproaches of the truth of <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine was Scandalized, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. at the beginning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. And our Doctrine of Iuſtification, Free-will, with other neceſſary truths, are ſo perverted by the Papiſts to their followers, that thereby great offence is given to the ignorant. So for wicked actions, they are Scandals, for thereby other are incouraged to evill, or made not ſo much to feare them (<hi>Math.</hi> 16.17.)

The neglect alſo of good things, whither private, or ſuch as belong to publique callings, whether Civill or Eccleſiaſticall. As the Magiſtrates Scanda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l is, when he doth not his duty in puniſhing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and cheriſhing the good; the ſcandall of Miniſters is, when they are negligent and careleſſe in their Miniſtry: and here chiefly, Nonreſidency and unſufficiency are grievous ſcandals; for hereby men are exceedingly weakned in the courſe of Piety, by the example of ſuch as are counted wiſe and learned, and ſo ſuch as whoſe example might ſafely be followed. And thus were the <hi>Phariſes</hi> a great Scandall to the common people of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> charges them. <hi>Math.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> They would not let the people enter into Heaven: There are alſo Scandals given, not only in doing things unlawfull in themſelves, but in things indifferent, which are not evill in themſelves. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> was a great Scandall, by his eating and living as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſo that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſtumbled by it; and this <hi>Paul</hi> teaches plainly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13, 14, 15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 9. chap. For though the nature and uſe of theſe things be alwayes lawful in themſelves, yet it may be offended in the externall uſage of them; for thereby another may be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either from the truth or Piety, as is ſeene, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of Scandals, are ſuch as are taken, not given. That is, that are of ſuch nature of themſelves as might incite to Piety, and might confirme in truth, but yet are abuſed to the contrary. And thus euery word or action, good in it ſelfe, may be the matter of Scandall, being taken to be evill, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be done ſlanderouſly out of malice, or out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe through ignorance. And that theſe are not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it may appeare, for even the moſt holy things are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this compaſſe: All theſe Scandals may be referred to three chiefe heads. Firſt, the word of God. Second, the works of God. Third, the godly, their ſayings and doings. For the firſt, the word of God is a Scandall, in either part of it, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Law or the Goſpell. The Law is to many a Scandall,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114018:19"/> either through ignorance or wilfulneſſe. Thus the <hi>Iewes</hi> were Scandalized through a carnall zeal they bare to the Lord; thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. The Law is a Scandall to out corruption, which while the Law reſtraines, it rages more and takes occaſion to work Concupiſcence and death. Thus alſo the impoſſibility of the Law is a great Scandall to ignorant men, they not conceiving how it ſhould be juſt with God to command things impoſſible, to corrupt nature.</p>
               <p>But chiefly, the Goſpell and Chriſt are great Scandals in the world, in ſo much, that Chriſt pronounced them bleſſed that were not ſcandalized at him. <hi>Math.</hi> 11. And wee have divers particular examples in this caſe. <hi>John</hi> 6.61. and 66. <hi>Math.</hi> 15.12. Some are Scandalized at the perſon of Chriſt, becauſe outwardly it was contemptible; ſome at his familiar converſing with ſinners; ſome at his ordinary kind of dyet; ſome for ſpeaking againſt traditions, ſome for derogating from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Law: ſome at his ſufferings and death; ſome at the Doctrine of juſtification, of ſpirituall eating his fleſh, and at the ſecret and free worke of Gods drawing men to him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. Some are offended at the diverſions that ariſes through the Goſpell, called for this end Fire. Some are offended at the croſſe that followes Chriſtian Profeſſion. Againe, many are offended at the condition and quality of the Church, as well in regard of the Preachers thereof, that they were ſimple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Fiſhermen, not learned Rabbins; and now the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thereof, mean men and no great wiſe men for the world. Some are offended at the Believers, that they are few, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and thoſe of the meaneſt ſort; Not many wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, as the word and worſhip of God is a great Scandall, ſo are the works of God: For man not being able to conceive the reaſon of them (for God doth not give a reaſon as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes) yet man thinking to meaſure them by the line of his crooked judgement, is offended at the varying from the ſame.

Some are offended to ſee the wicked as live in pleaſure, ſo die in Peace, without diſturbance, when as yet the godly, beſides the evill in their lives time, have much bitterneſſe of ſoule and body in their death. Of all theſe the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeakes excellently. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. and the laſt verſe, <hi>The wayes of the Lord are Righteous, the Righteous ſhall walke in them, but the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall ſtumble at them.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Gods children in their practices are an eye-ſore and offence to the ungodly, what ever they doe, or ſay, they are not pleaſed. Neither <hi>Iohns</hi> Auſterity, nor <hi>Chriſts</hi> Lenity did pleaſe the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and this in ſome is through ignorance, while good is taken for evill, and evill for good.

Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> was offended with <hi>Elias, Ahaziah</hi> and <hi>Iehoram,</hi> with <hi>Elizeus, Ahab</hi> with <hi>Michaiah, Daniel</hi> offenſive to <hi>Darius</hi> Courtiers; but God forbid that the Righteous ſhould forſake his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for all theſe things. And thus we haue ſeene the divers kinds of Scandall againſt others, either God or men. The Scripture alſo ſhewes how men are Scandals to themſelves; becauſe, by corrupt words, affections and luſts, they doe make themſelves at leaſt to ſaker and be ſlothfull in the way of Salvation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114018:20"/> in the whole courſe of life; that knowing them, wee may avoid them. But the further uſe of it will appeare in that that followes. Having ſpoken ſufficiently of the firſt point, let us come to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point, is the Miſery, for leaſt Chriſt might be thought to ſpeake of a light or unneceſſary matter, he doth forewarne that it is moſt weighty, as being not the leaſt cauſe of the miſeries and judgements of God on the world. And this is ſet down in the word <hi>Woe, woe:</hi> which comprehends all evils, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 2.20. It is a word of one ſorrowing, which in great griefe and lamentation is uſually taken up of mourners, whither for themſelves or for others. And Chriſt doth here partly expreſſe the heavineſſe of it, by that is added. <hi>It were better a Mill ſtone were hang'd about ones neck and he cast into the Sea.</hi> So that here it is uſed figuratively (being a Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymya of the effect for the cauſe.) For a great and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evill, which is to come on the world through Scandals. For it muſt needs be a moſt fearfull calamity, wherby not one or two, but the whole world ſhould be driven to an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate kind of mourning; becauſe the judgements on the ſame are univerſall and grievous.</p>

               <p>No doubt, Chriſt that wept in compaſſion for <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> did not utter this lamentable Prophecy without great griefe of heart.

               </p>
               <p>And as touching the number of theſe which are taken with theſe Scandals as with the traps of Satan, they are not a few, but the whole World; that is the greateſt part of the World, that the whole World may ſeeme to periſh by this fraud: Now in both theſe regards, this evill is moſt heavy and fearfull, for the Salvation of one man is more worth then the whole World; for all the riches of it, will not pay the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of one ſoule: and what ought to be more ſought for by us of God, then that wee dayly aske, <hi>That his Kingdome may come, and his will be done;</hi> but when wee ſee the whole World to be carryed away from God through Scandals, what is leſſe done then that wee deſire; yea, the contrary is daily practiſed; how much vexation then muſt needs come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>How great, long agone have the Scandals of Religion been evill examples of the Truth deſpiſed.

               <p>And, as if we were not miſerable enough by our own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wickedneſſe, the Divell doth outwardly miniſter Scandals by all our ſenſes, that whitherſoever we turne our eyes, eares, or whatſoever we do, we incurre ſome grievous Scandall, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given or taken.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But whence comes this neceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a threefold reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt, is from the revenging hand of God; for it muſt needs be that God be juſt, and his juſtice doth require, that his ſacred truth and infinite mercy in Chriſt, being offered to the World are contemned and ſcorned, he ſhould ſuffer Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals to ariſe every where, wherewith, they that would not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth ſincerely; being deluded, might be carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to deſtruction, that thoſe that have loved error and ſinne, might periſh in their own ſnares, and in the fire, themſelves had made.</p>
               <p>This is manifeſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11. Examples of this, we have in <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.15. The like <hi>Amos,</hi> 7.10. And moſt plainly, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. Of <hi>Ahab,</hi> who refuſing the true Prophets, God permitted the Divell to bee a lying Spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets, to ſeduce him. This is one reaſon of <hi>Mahometiſme</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For when the world began to loath the true God, he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe falſe Doctrines to ariſe to ſeduce many; So that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Antichriſt aroſe, who challenged the authority of God to himſelf, in abrogating divine Ordinances, and making new, in binding Conſcience, in pardoning Sin, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a God of the Bread, and how many follow this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! Now whence is it, but that by the juſt Judgement of God, they daſh againſt this Rock, which have not received a love of the truth. And the ſame Iudgement of God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; for when the love of Religion hath long ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to decay, God hath ſent ſuch as ſhall embrace the ſame in ſhew onely.</p>
               <p>Hath not this Scandall cauſed, that many who began to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Religion long ſince, have made yet ſo ſmall progreſſe. Many that had gone well on, are gone backward, and few that increaſing, perſevere: hence it comes by Gods juſt judgement, that the evill wee ſee in others, we follow as a Banner diſplayed.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt Reaſon of this neceſſity, which teaches, that men are farre off from that happineſſe, they dreaming, feyne
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114018:24"/> to themſelves, while they injoy occaſions and liberty of Sin without controlement; for then are they carried with the heavieſt judgement of God, if they had eyes to ſee it, as the Prophets above did bewayle the peoples caſe in this behalf, and ſuch as Chriſt in juſtice, left the <hi>Phariſes</hi> unto; ſaying. <hi>Let them alone:</hi> and the Scripture, <hi>Hee that is filthy, let him bee filthy,</hi> Dan. 12.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond Reaſon of this neceſſity, is the Depravation of man; for it muſt needs be: to wit, Mans wicked nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as it is, confirmed by evill cuſtome. As it muſt needs be, that Fire burne, and an evill Tree brings evill fruit. So it can not be, that our corruption ſhould bring forth any thing but evill. Not that this depravation was planted in us by our Maker, but that wee voluntarily have contracted the ſame to us in the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> for if it were in us by Creation, it could not bee put off by no meanes, nor in no meaſure: As by no meanes, the Fire can be made to coole, or the Stone to flye; and therefore, ſeeing many holy men doe in part put of this Corruption, it is apparent, it is not Eſſentiall to mans nature.</p>
               <p>Now the particular Corruptions, which in men are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſes and inſtruments of Scandall are theſe. Firſt, a want of the love of God and his Truth. Second, the want of the Love of our Neighbour. Hatred againſt ſome private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, love of our eſtimation, profits, pleaſures, honours; and in generall the whole corruption of man, whereby the tongue is made a Scandall by evill ſpeaking, the members of the body by being weapons of iniquity. Blindneſſe of mind, froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of will, perverſeneſſe of affections, ſelfe-love, naughty Conſcience, conceit of ones own wit, holineſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and an aptneſſe to receive any evill from another, as one body receives infection from another. Theſe are the ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſes, to which the Divell inſinuates himſelfe.</p>
               <p>

                  </label> This conſideration doth ſerve lively to decipher to us the greatneſſe of the evill of ſinne and naturall Corruption, ſeeing it is a ſin, and a cauſe of ſin and much woe and miſery, and in all theſe, takes away all excuſe from man, as will appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:114018:25"/>
               <p>The third reaſon, is the finall cauſe of Scandall, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Elect, is their tryall; for it is the will of the Father, that the elect be tryed, that the chaff may be ſevered from the wheat, that his gold might be purged his power in preſerving, might ſhine in our weakneſſe, and his mercy in our miſery. And the truth and power of Gods graces might be knowne to be greater while thereby the godly are preſerved from the common infection. As we admire thoſe conſtitutions, on thoſe receits of Art, whereby men living in the midſt of an infected ayre and perſons; are yet free from the infection: this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration affords a double uſe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> Firſt, It is a ſingular comfort to the godly in this neceſſity of ſo great miſery, that theſe Scandals are onely for their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and not for their confuſion it may be; their feet may trip againſt theſe blocks, ſo that for a while they may goe ſlowly forward in the wayes of Piety; but they ſhall never ſo fall, as to depart from God and his truth. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.24. There ſhould be ſuch ſtrange deluſions, that if it were poſſible, the Elect ſhould be ſeduced, thereby inferring to their endleſſe comfort, that it is not poſſible. This is the priviledge of Gods children, and the ſtaffe of comfort in all miſeries.</p>
               <p>

                  </label> Second, this may ſerve to admoniſh unſtable perſons, as Browniſts, who if they be the children of God, as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, they ſhall not be prejudiced in their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It ſhall be only for their tryall, therefore; conſidering this end why God permits theſe Scandals, it ſhould be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall meanes to ſtrengthen them againſt them: it ſhall turn to our further praiſe and glory, if we can will and without offence in the midſt of a froward and crooked generation: And thus much of the Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, a ſecret objection offers it ſelf, to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, which is this.</p>

                  </gap> and puniſhment, for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114018:25"/> there is a double Neceſſity. The firſt, is of Coaction or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, when by ſome outward force, and not of any internall and voluntary motion; one is compelled to the doing of a thing. As a ſtone by force is made to fly upward.</p>
               <p>If ſuch a neceſſity lay on man, as whereby he were made to ſin againſt his will, then he were free from all fault. But when as this neceſſity do adde no violence to the will, but it is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly by its owne ſwing to wickedneſſe, as loving the ſame, this Neceſſity hath no excuſe; becauſe it takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way freedome.</p>
               <p>This is briefly ſet down, but excellently by that learned and judicious writer Doctor <hi>Abbot,</hi> out of <hi>Barnard. It is a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and miſerable free Neceſſity, wherein, neither can neceſſity,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Will, becauſe it is voluntary; nor the will exclude neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, becauſe it is intangled with delight therein.</hi> Wherein, Will takes from man, all matter of defence, and neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves him of poſſibility of amendment of himſelfe. So that the Will in a ſtrange wiſe cauſes this Neceſſity to her ſelf, for there is one way, Neceſſity by the habit of corruption; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, liberty by the free motion of the Will.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Vſe.</head>
                  <p>Hence we learne, that excuſe that men make, pleading Neceſſity, is a falſe plea and unſufficient, ſeeing this Neceſſity is ſuch as was voluntary, and was alſo contracted and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our own default. <hi>The Philoſophers could ſay, That hee that offended by Drunkenneſſe, was worthy of double puniſhment; Firſt, for his fault; Secondly, for his Drunkenneſſe.</hi> So, men are ſo farre from helping themſelves hereby, as that they doe but aggravate the matter and provoke the Iudge; for who would endure a Thiefe reaſoning thus: I can doe no otherwiſe, it is ſo ſweet to me, and I have been ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to this courſe.</p>
                  <p>Second, when it is ſaid, <hi>Woe be to that man by whom the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence comes, &amp;c.</hi> So Chriſt doth ſhew, that that <hi>Woe</hi> which belongs to the authors of Scandals, is farre heavier, then that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114018:26"/> which before was ſhewed to hang over the World.

Shewing whence Chriſt came, wherefore; and what great need we had of his help. <label>Three things.</label> Theſe words then teach three things. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the calling of Chriſt to the undertaking of the Office of Reconciliation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Second the deſcription of the Office it ſelfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Third, the particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with the ſubject or object of the ſame. The calling is in the firſt words, and comprehends two things. Firſt, Chriſts ſufficiency and furniture. Second, his Ordination and inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into his Office. Let us ſee the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>The Spirit. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11.2. The Spirit with all the gifts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are upon him; is ſent and given by God the Father, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in Chriſt. Yet it is ſaid upon him becauſe the Spirit came down from heaven and did viſibly reſt on him. On me, <hi>I, that is on my Humanity. Math.</hi> 3.16. So that theſe words ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thus much.</p>
               <p>The gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, proceeding from God my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth reſide and dwell in this my Humanity, which yee ſee; by which gifts, I am ſanctified to this Office of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> But it may be ſaid, what Excellency hath Chriſt by this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others; for the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> affirmes the like of him, and ſo may other Holy men, that they have the Spirit.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> To this, anſwer is, That that of <hi>Eſay</hi> is chiefly to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Chriſt, and not of himſelfe; and with great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Spirit doth reſide in Chriſt and in others. And this difference appeares in two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the Univerſality of the gifts in Chriſt. Second, in the Perfection of gifts. As touching the firſt God did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow one or two, or moe gifts on the Humanity of Chriſt, but he powred them out moſt plentifully on him. <hi>John</hi> 3.34, 35. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3.9. It pleaſed the Father, that all fullneſſe ſhould dwell in him: all gifts are not given to one, but to every member, as much as ſeemes good to the Spirit of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. For as the head is the common receptacle of all the ſenſes, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114018:28"/> doth excerciſe their faculties, when as yet, every Senſe hath it diſtinct Office; In the execution whereof, they are imployed. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> So our head Chriſt, is moſt fully furniſhed with all neceſſary gifts, to the animating of his body, when as yet the members of his body have their ſeverall functions and parts, in which all their faculty or ability is circumſcribed.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, all the gifts of Chriſt were moſt perfit in him, perfit Wiſdome, Knowledge, Iuſtice, Holineſſe; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choate, but in their perfit maturity. There was no defect of any gift, or in any; but all were miniſtred unto, abſolute in all parts and degrees, to the full perfection of his Humanity; and this not only from ſome time of his Age, but from his firſt Conception. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. To his Reſurrection and Aſcention. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
               <p>Now the gifts, given to the Saints, are only the firſt fruits, a handfull and as earneſt-pence. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Wee know but in part, we Love but in part. So that wee may eaſily ſee, how farre the dwelling of the Spirit in holy men, differs from the manner of the ſame in Chriſt. In the one without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in the other in meaſure. In Chriſt full, in us in part; in him Primarily, In us, Secondarily. So that as great difference as there is twixt the ſpring, and the ſtreame flowing thence. Twixt the light of the Moone and ſtarres, and the Sun. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> The one being borrowed and imperfit, the other being originall, and alwayes e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uall. So great difference is there twixt Chriſt and his Saints in regard of gifts. And indeed, this plenitude of gifts, is one of the peculiar Prerogatives, which the Humanity of Chriſt hath received by the Hypoſtaticall union; neither can they be found in any other perſon, who is not God and man.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> The uſe of this, is to teach us to truſt perfitly in the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought by Ieſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. For wee ſee here, what a Mediator and Reconciler we had, who is all ſufficient, which when alone it is peculiar to Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8. It muſt needs be, that the Office of Reconciliation belongs to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Neither is Chriſt unfit for any part of it, or defective, who hath all gifts, and in all degrees. Neither is any other fit for any part of that Office, ſeeing there is perfection in none.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114018:29"/> So that neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any Saint dead or alive; may preſume to offer themſelves to partake in this Function, much leſſe may any intrude themſelves. We may not faine to our ſelves other Mediators, it is a burden too heavy for any to undergo. If <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. at the end. Who is fit for theſe things, to wit, to be a Servant and an inſtrument in adminiſtring any part of theſe things, then who may be found meet to be the Lord and diſpoſer of theſe. Chriſt admits no companions in any part of his Office, either Regall in binding Conſcience and giving Laws, in opening or ſhutting; or in his Prieſtly Office of Praying or Sacraficing or Suffering; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Propheticall Office of inward effectuall teaching. Here then is overthrown the blaſphemous Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> uſurping all theſe, being farre unfit for any of them.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  </label> Second Vſe to the faithfull and all that want, to draw out of this fullneſſe. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. Both all new graces that are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as alſo new ſtrength and increaſe of the Graces we have received. And this muſt be done by a lively Faith apprehending Chriſt, eſteeming him above all, deſiring him before all, and delighting in him more then all, till wee may enjoy his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence: neither need wee feare any defect; a Spring the more drawn, the faſter it riſes: Pray wee then, that ſeeing we have a dry ground, the Lord would give us of the ſpringing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Spirit, that wee be not ſcorched with heat, or pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with drought.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> Third, for comfort to the godly. No true members of Chriſt can faile no more then that River can faile, whoſe ſpring ceaſes not, or that houſe fall, whoſe foundation ſtands ſure. No more then thoſe members of that body can wither or dye, whoſe head failes not to derive, Senſe, motion and Spirit, and is alſo able to remove al inward lets. Thus much then of Chriſts ſufficiency. Now let us ſee his right of executing his Office, which appeares by his Inſtalling and Ordination: In theſe words. <hi>He hath Annointed me.]</hi> This is a Metonymicall ſpeech of the adjunct, for the ſubject of the ſigne for the thing ſignified. For God appointed that the chiefe Magiſtrates, when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114018:29"/> they entred into their Offices, ſhould be annoynted with holy Oyle; and now the chiefe Magiſtrate among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> was either Civill or Eccleſiaſticall: the Civill, was the King, who was Annoynted. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.1, and 16. chap. 14. The Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, was either extraordinary, or ordinary; this, was the high Prieſt. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.30. chap. The other was the Prophet. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.16.</p>
               <p>Now this Oyle did ſignifie the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were to be endewed, which entred and executed theſe Offices. And becauſe the Annoynting was uſed at ſuch time as they were conſecrated, it is but for the Conſecration it ſelf, and inveſting into the Office. And therefore, theſe words, <hi>He hath Annointed me,</hi> import thus much. <note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Text.</note> For this cauſe, God my Father hath ordained me to this Function, and hath given me power to execute the ſame. Further, touching this Annoynting, two things is to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> Firſt, to which of the three Offices was Chriſt Annointed. </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> To this, anſwer is made, to all Three. </p>
               <p>Men indeed, becauſe they receive the Spirit by meaſure, divers are Annoynted to divers Offices, one not being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſcharge many. But Chriſt being furniſhed with all fulneſſe of Spirit, is moſt ſufficient for all the three Offices.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> The ſecond thing touching this Annoynting, is, when and how was it done, for we read not of the doing of it at any time, nor in any place.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> For anſwer to this, we muſt know. Firſt, He was not Annointed with outward or material Oyle, but with the thing ſignified by the Oyle, the Spirit it ſelf. And this was done in his Baptiſme in <hi>Jordan. Math.</hi> 3. at the end. When he was almoſt thirty yeeres old.</p>
               <p>Now where the Truth is, what needs the ſhadow. And we read in Scripture of ſome ſaid to be Annoynted, before there was the materiall Oyle, of the inward Spirituall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.15. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.16. <hi>Eliſha</hi> is ſaid to be Annoynted, and yet had nothing but <hi>Elias</hi> Cloake caſt on him.</p>

                  </label> But you will ſay, if the preſence of the Spirit, be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114018:30"/> then Chriſt was Annoynted in his very Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">

                  </label> To this anſwer is made, that there is a two-fold Annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The one was Sanctity of nature, and this was from the Conception. But the other was for a publik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Office, and that was only in Baptiſme, by the viſible ſhape of the Holy Ghoſt, and with the voyce of the Father: having ſeene the meaning, let us ſee the inſtruction.</p>

                  </label> 1. Doctrine. Chriſt did not of his own ſwing and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell leap into the Office of Reconciliation, but by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Ordination of God and the Holy Spirit. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was done by Chriſt in that Office, was done by the will and common conſent of the Trinity. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. chap. 4, and 5. verſes.</p>
               <p>So that whoſoever embraces Chriſt, he doth by the ſame meanes and at the ſame time come into favour with the whole Trinity, who committed this Office to Chriſt; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they that deſpiſe Chriſt the Annoynted of God, in vain do they boaſt of God; when as together with Chriſt, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Father and the Spirit.

                  </label> 2. Doctrine. No Creature, Man, or Angell, can perform this high Office but Chriſt alone; to whom is given fulneſſe of the Spirit; yea, not only are any able, but it it not lawfull for any to attempt the ſame but Chriſt alone; becauſe there was none ever ordained or Conſecrated to this Office beſides him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.27. Him hath the Father ſealed; to wit as with his Letters Patents teſtifying, that Chriſt his Son is the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator by whom he will be Reconciled. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.

                  </gap>ciling the World. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Chriſt is made to us of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. There is no other Name or Perſon. by whom we may; yea, or by whom it is lawfull to ſeeke Salvation. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. at the end <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Him hath God annoynted. So that alwayes, the Apoſtles from this, inferre that this Chriſt is the <hi>Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that all are accuſed of falſification and forgery before
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114018:30"/> God, who preſume to Tranſlate the praiſe of this to any other then Chriſt, for they goe about to Corrupt the Authentike Seale of God.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> So that this ſerves both to demonſtrate and refute the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious boldneſſe of the Papiſts, in obtruding any into any part of the Office of Chriſt; for be it granted, that any, either Man or Angell, were found without ſin and had the fulneſſe of the Spirit, yet might not ſuch preſume, nor any for him, to put him into this Office; becauſe not only ſufficiency is required, but alſo Ordination from God. Now this can no where be ſhewed, that God appointed any other. If Chriſt ſhould need any aſſiſtant, it is either becauſe he cannot or will not beare the whole burden, himſelfe. The one whereof is moſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous againſt the power of God. And the other is moſt dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the infinite love and bountifulneſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Though in a Land, there may be many fit for an Office yet if by Charter, the Kings Majeſty grant it to one alone, who dare preſume, not only not to ſet up another, but not ſo much as go to any other about that buſineſſe or Office, but he ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the Kings diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>And ſhall we not thinke, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> that if any ſeeke for Salvation at the hand of any other, then at this <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that God ſhall not be offended? Shall one Sun in the Firmament ſuffice to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the whole World and ſhall not the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Christ Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Better had theſe men controuled any of the workes of Gods Creation (yet a woe belongs to ſuch) then of Redemption; and as their madneſſe would appeare, who to help the Sun, would light Candels, at noone day. So no leſſe madly deale they, who would adjoyn any aſſiſtants unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Second the meditation of this. That God annoynted Chriſt, is the foundation of Chriſtian comfort, both in that we may be aſſured, that no exception can be taken againſt Chriſt, who was ſent by God himſelfe; as alſo becauſe God out of his infinite and free Love to Man-kind, gave Chriſt to be a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. And this the Scripture oft beats on, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 25, 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. at the end. And Chriſt himſelfe.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114018:31"/> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.17. <hi>So God loved the World.</hi> For wee being the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that had offended, a Mediator ſhould have beene procured by us and from us. But we were unable to ſupply any, becauſe we were children of wrath. Behold and wonder! It was Man that had offended, it was God that was injured; and therefore, in all reaſon it was, that if man could not by himſelf, yet he ſhould have ſought out one, who might have ſtood twixt God and him to make an atonement. But loe, the contrary, God offended, and Man offending; even God I ſay, the Creator, all-ſufficient in himſelfe and bleſſed for ever. And man, a worme, a wretch before him, yet this great God vouchſafes to ſend an embaſſage to us weake men to entreat of conditions of Peace, and to offer the bloud of his own Son to be ſhed who was the Embaſſadour to confirme the league of Peace twixt himſelf and us. Was there ever any love like this, and wonderfull! Oh the Ocean of comfort! O endleſſe love, how ſhould this confirme weake Conſciences. How can we doubt that the Lord will fayle his, when he hath done this for them all ready!

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114018:36"/> Scripture, as whereby all the wiles of the Papiſts may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and avoided. They commonly teach, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is the new Law, and a more perfit Law, whence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their Doctrines of Counſell and works of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But alas, if the Goſpell were a more perfit Law, it were wofull tydings to all mankind: Hereby alſo may appeare that the Law and Goſpell cannot be joyned in the point of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for as theſe two are quite contrary. To to do a thing by our ſelves and to do it by another; to have a thing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and to have it of free gift, and ſuch are the Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in the juſtification of a ſinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Preach deliverance to the Captives.]</hi> That which before was ſet down in generall only, both in regard of the Benefit, as alſo of the Miſery of man; this ſame, after the uſuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Scripture, is deſcribed more particularly and as oppoſites ſet together, doe make each other more conſpicuous; ſo is it here, a Miſery and a mercy, a defect and a ſupply. And as the diſeaſe is before the remedy, ſo it muſt firſt be handled: and it is expreſſed in the word <hi>Captives,</hi> wherein as before, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and bodily Captivity is uſed to expreſſe and declare our inward miſerable Captivity and bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Captives.]</hi> As God ſold his people into their Enemies hands, ſuffered their houſes to be pulled down, the fields and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards to be ſpoyled, and in wrath to commit them to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; even ſo, through ſin we fall into a moſt cruell bondage, far paſſing that of <hi>Aegypt</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> both for the miſery it ſelfe, as alſo for want of meanes of deliverance. Now this Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is foure-fold. The firſt Captivity is under Originall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the Mind is captived in the chaines of ignorance, errour and vanity: The Will is manacied with perverſeneſſe, the Affections with contrariety, violence, inſolency and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and by the daily fruit of this, by actuall tranſgreſſions, we bring our ſelves into a great bondage, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who had not ſo much as a weapon among them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Captivity is under Satan. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. at the end <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2, 3. Wherein he <hi>deales no leſſe cruelly

               <p>The third, is the dominion of actuall tranſgreſſion and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full corruption and affections under which the wicked ſerve a moſt ſore bondage. <hi>One being a ſlave to Luſt, another to Pride, another to his Belly, a fourth to Honours;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Here is two points. Firſt of the kind or manner of our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Second, of the Meaſure of it.

Third, by force and violence Fourth, by price and Ranſome. The firſt of theſe hath no place in our Deliverance; for whom or for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114018:37"/> what ſhould the exchange bee. But for the other three means, though they are differing, yet do all ſweetly agree and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in our deliverance: For if we look into the Originall and fountain of our deliverance. It ſtreames from the moſt free and everlaſting love of God, yea from the bowels of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in our God, pittying us in our miſery. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.75, 76, 77, 78.</p>
               <p>Againe, if we conſider Satan, who did cruelly detain us in bondage, we are delivered by force. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.16, 17. And <hi>Luke</hi> 11.27. Chriſt buckled with Satan and ſpoyled his holds and triumphed over him. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. and 30. If we reſpect the juſtice of God, which was offended, and ſo had juſtly given us over to thraldome. We are delivered by the all-ſufficient ranſome and ſatisfaction which Chriſt made and paid, whereby Gods wrath is appeaſed, the Law fulfilled, and through the efficacy of the ſaid death and reſurrection in the hearts of Gods children by the Spirit of God, the power and dominion of ſin is aboliſhed, his ſtrength abated, and man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with the ſtrength of God to encounter againſt ſin. And thus much of the kind and manner of Deliverances.</p>
               <p>Now followes the Meaſure, which is not fully as yea, in regard of actuall enjoying the ſame. Not that there is any defect in our Deliverer, nor that any dammage ſhall enſue to us thereby; but this is ſo diſpoſed of, as may turne to Gods greater glory and our further good.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Davids</hi> Embaſſadours were disfigured with their ſhorne beards, and curtayled cloathes, they were not meet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to come into his Preſence, but were enjoyned to ſtay for a time.</p>
               <p>Even ſo, being deformed and mangled with Sin, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> and ugly Lazars, we are unfit to come into that glorious preſence, till we be wholly ſtripped of the Old man, and clad with the New, which will not be, but by death. So that Gods wrath is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy removed, the guilt and condemnation of ſin is taken away with the dominion. Only the reliques remaines and bodily death, but ſo as they ſhall no whit hinder our full deliverance.</p>
               <p>So that, true it is; we muſt Dye, <label type="milestone">

Have we not a Promiſe wee ſhall vanquiſh. When we were weake, unskilfull in battell; nay, wilfull not liſting to fight, and our Enemies were ſtrong, reſolute and well appointed, no marvell if wee turned our backe. But now that the advantage is to us, and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our Adverſaries, what can wee ſay, if we faint? who will pitty that man that ſuffers himſelfe eaſily to be ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of his goods by Robbers, having on himſelfe good armour and well weaponed, and being ſtronger then the Thiefe. Let us then ſtand faſt and not betray our Liberty, but oft medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the bitterneſſe of our former bondage: one that being long in Priſon, and there fed of ſcraps; if being delivered, he paſſe by and ſees other at his old dyet, hee partly trembles, partly his ſtomack riſes at it, and ſo ſhould it be with us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This doth admoniſh us of <hi>Thankefulneſſe:</hi> No benefit to this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. The night of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſolemnly to be kept. Yet this was nothing, and therefore to be forgotten in compariſon of the Deliverance from <hi>Babell, Ierem.</hi> 16.14. Now this of ours farre exceeds both the other, as being but temporary and bodily Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from Miſeries ceazing on the body, which Death would have ended. And yet for this, how doth the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſtirre up the people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>To thankefulneſſe,</hi> verſes 1, 2, 8, 13, 16, 21, 31. Nay, it is to bee obſerved, that the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Deliverance from the bondage and guilt of Sin, calls all Creatures to rejoyce with Man, for this his happineſſe, and the fruit of it, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44.22.24. <hi>Rejoyce yee heavens for the Lord hath done it, &amp;c.</hi> Eſa. 49.13.

Acts</hi> 2.13. Till they were pricked, and then they ſang another ſong. The like <hi>John</hi> 4.11.12. A lewd Strumpet could frump Chriſt till her ſins were laid open.

Was alive in his own conceit, and thought himſelfe a jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, and ſo proudly ſcorned, yea perſecuted the Doctrine of Chriſt. <hi>Now to the procuring of this ſight and ſenſe, there is required a lively ſight of Sin, as it is ſet forth in the glaſſe of the Law, with the hainouſneſſe and filthineſſe thereof, as being againſt an infinite Majeſty, againſt a holy Law, and ſo moſt vile, againſt a good Law and ſo moſt evill, againſt a juſt Law,</hi>

               <p>If we did daily look the face of ſin in the glaſſe of all theſe, it would awake us, and make us to fly from the vengeance to come. To this end it was, that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſo thundred before
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114018:40"/> Chriſt; hence it was, that Chriſt ſo opened the Law, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirituall ſenſe and deepe ſearch of the Law.

                  <hi>Recovering of ſight to the Blind.]</hi> This is the third compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon or Metaphor expreſſing our miſery, by a word fetched from the defect of bodily ſight, and applyed to the Mind. This ſhall not need much to be inſiſted in, becauſe partly it hath been handled before as a branch of our Spirituall Captivity. Yet becauſe the Scripture is moſt frequent in the uſe of this, as much delighting in it it ſhall be profitable a little to view the Spirituall blindneſſe by that of the body, the underſtanding is the eye of the Soule, and the informer and director to the Will, affections, and ſo to all our actions; now therefore for it to be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For if the eye be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſſe: and if the blind lead the blind both ſhall fall into the ditch; now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth exceedingly beat of the minds blindneſſe; true it is, that in things pertaining to this life, there is ſome conceits; as alſo in Morall and Civill actions and Vertues. But in the chief, to wit, in things Spirituall; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is ſtarke blind. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, 12. Where the reaſon is given, becauſe the things of God cannot be diſcerned, but by the Spirit of God; as none can know what is in man, but the Spirit of man; and in the 14 verſe of the ſame chapter, he ſhewes that the naturall man diſcernes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114018:42"/> not the things of the Spirit of God; yea they are folly to him. So that, as a Beaſt is ſtarke blind in things to be apprehended by reaſon, neither can they be made ſo plaine, that he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; becauſe he wants reaſon. Even ſo, things Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Spirituall cannot be comprehended by the depth of reaſon. The truth of this doth further appeare by the eſtate of men, both within and without the Church at ſuch time as Chriſt came into the fleſh, and the Goſpell began to flouriſh. In the Church was many learned Scribes and Phariſes, and yet they could not ſee Chriſt that was the Sunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and how ignorant did <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſhew himſelfe, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe bodily defects may be ſupplyed by others, if thou beeſt blind, thou mayſt be guided. But here every man muſt have an eye for himſelfe, anothers knowledge will doe thee no good if thou remaine blind thy ſelfe.</hi> Now as bodily blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to any whatſoever is very uncomfortable and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.

                  </gap>om wholſome meats, yet for ſome men of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall condition to be blind is very prejudicious. As firſt, <hi>For a Travailer who can take never a ſtep forward but is either rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtumble, or to fall into ſome ditch, or to go out of his way.</hi> So that if ſome be not adjoyned that guide him, (which is here denyed) he muſt needs periſh, by one misfortune or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, running into the mouths of wild devouring beaſts while he ſtraggles the Forreſt of this World. Secondly, <hi>For a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114018:43"/> to be blind is moſt heavie and miſerable, for he can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee nothing, nor diſcover evils approaching. Thirdly, for a a Souldier, becauſe he muſt needs be wounded, not knowing which way to decline the battery againſt him. Fourthly, for an overſeer and keeper of precious Jewels and ſuch like. Now all theſe are our conditions, we are Travailers in the unbeaten and ſtrait way to Heaven. We are all and ought to be Watch-men to foreſee the Iudgements of God; we are all Souldiers in the Lords Battle; we are all keepers of our own Soules and what other precious Jewels we have from God,</hi> Which the Divell lyes in wayt for. How miſerable then needs muſt the condition of Man be, by reaſon of this blindneſſe.</p>

                  </label> This ſerves to teach us to take notice of the Worlds miſery, and to bewayle it both in our ſelves and others: <hi>We can take it for a great Iudgement for any to be borne blind in body. Yet we never bewayle our ſelves, being ſuch in Soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Second, Hence may we learne a reaſon of the Worlds bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in going on in Sin, as that of the Proverb, Who ſo bold as blind Bayard. <hi>The blind man becauſe he ſees no danger, he fears none.</hi> That which the eye ſees not, the heart rues not. One plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding through a deſart of wild beaſts in the night though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually there is but a ſtep twixt him and death, he feares no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but if the Light ariſe, and he ſee in what danger he is, he is at his wits end for feare. So is it with blind ignorant men. Now whither this Ignorance be ſimple or affected, whither in the mind or in the reſtraining of the knowledge, through per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe violentneſſe of affections, or ſelfe-conceit, the danger is alike; yea greater to theſe latter, as is ſeene in the Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi>

                  </label> Laſtly, hence may wee learne the reaſon, why after ſo long teaching and diligence, there is great Ignorance. It comes from the blindneſſe of mans mind and heart, which is ſo habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and hath ſo hardned mans heart, that the Seed fals as on the high-way, and the fowles, that is, Satan devoures it, and thus much of the miſery.

                  <hi>Recovery of ſight.]</hi> We read of Chriſt giving ſight to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blind in body, all which were ſhadowes of this great work
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114018:43"/> of Spirituall Illumination, this benefit is in generall, the grace of Sanctification or more eſpecially of Illumination and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an wiſdome and prudence whereby wee may be made to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne twixt things that differ. How great and neceſſary this benefit is, may appeare both by <hi>Pauls</hi> earneſt Prayer unto God in the behalfe of the <hi>Epheſians. Epheſ.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. and 18, 19, 20. And his putting them in mind of it, having received it. <hi>Yee were darkneſſe, but now yee are Light,</hi> and ſo alſo his earneſt Thankſgiving for it in all his Epiſtles. as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, and 12. verſes. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.3, 4. And ſo in both his Epiſtles to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> Wee may ſee it alſo by the earneſt Prayers of <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 119. And by that ſerious counſell that Chriſt gives to the Church of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea.</hi> Now for the manner how Chriſt doth performe this, we muſt know, that there are three things required to good Sight. Firſt, a cleere Object. Second, a right Organ or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the eyes. Third, the Medium or meanes of tranſporting the Object to the eye.</p>
               <p>Now in all theſe regards, Chriſt doth help the ſight. For firſt, for the Eye it ſelfe, the Mind; he doth cauſe the thicke ſcales to fall off, and doth take away all inward diſturbances and annoyances, and fits it for the right performing of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſettles the eye, that it be not diſtorted.</p>
               <p>Secondly Chriſt helpes the ſight by cleering the Object, and making it neerer to our view. For if the thing to be ſeene with the bodily eye, be either darke or too remote, it is not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Such were heavenly things, they were too darke and hard for us, they were too farre off, too ſmall: God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us Spectacles, to make them ſeeme bigger; the Word is made more eaſie and cleere, in the face of Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. The vaile is taken away, and we all behold with open face the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, verſe 17, 18. And ſo for the Medium or meanes, that is ſhould not be too much diſturbed; the Lord hath given gifts to men, for the further opening of the Word, and for the expelling or removing thoſe outward hinderances, which might darken the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> This ſerves to ſhew unto us the great benefit of the Word,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114018:44"/> which is oft compared to Light, eſpecially the Goſpell. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.78, 79. This Chriſt himſelfe taught. <hi>Math.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>Shall we eſteeme it a great benefit to have a Torch or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne held out in a darke night and ſhall we not eſteeme this. Doth not this make us eſcape the Woe of thoſe who through ignorance call Light darkeneſſe, good evill, and ſower ſweet: How joyfull is the light and comfortable, who would deſire to live in the World, if <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſſe poſſeſſed it. How is the true ſtate of every thing hid in the darkneſſe; bad Wares are not known from good. Counterfeit God from current. Croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked things from ſtreight, falſe wayes from right, cleane things from unclean; deformed from beautifull. So that while wee were in Ignorance, we lay ſecure in our ſin, and had periſhed in our ſecurity, never miſdeeming our eſtate; but as <hi>Agar</hi> and her Son did ſcoffe at <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo ſhould we have done at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Heaven. And as <hi>Agar</hi> caſt forth, &amp; in perplexity was vexed, till God further opened her eyes to ſee the Well. So when by the Law wee had beene awaked to ſee our ugly face and fearfull eſtate, wee ſhould utterly have diſpaired, if God had not ſhewed us a ſecond viſion of the Goſpell. Oh then, with what thankfulneſſe and reverence ſhould we embrace this Light and ſight thereby, as the blind man in the Goſpell, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Second, <hi>let us walke in the Light;</hi> the night is paſt and the day is come, let us walke honeſtly as in the day time. Let us walke in the light while we have it; and now having ſight, let us not wallow in filthineſſe as before, let us direct our paths aright, and order our ſteps by counſell, carefully avoiding whatſoever might draw us out of the right way to Salvation. And having our eyes reſtored, let us learne oft to look up to our Maker. And thus much of the third manner of expreſſing our Miſery.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114018:45"/> degree of mans Miſery, and doth adde weight to the former. For to be poore and deſtitute of neceſſaries, is heavy; but if that any diſeaſe or torment be added, the burden is heavier. But if to theſe two, there come a third affliction, that the ſame ſhould be taken Captive, carryed into a ſtrange Countrey, bee evill entreated, farre from all friends and acquaintance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of returne. Where this is, what is wanting to the perfection of miſery; yet ſo it is with man. And all this is cauſed by one and the ſame thing; namely Sin, for as in regard of Spirituall riches, it being poverty; and as it lookes unto the Law, it wounds the Conſciences and breakes the heart, as is after ſhewed. So as it reſpects Satan, it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpheare under which we are ſold, the chaines wherewith we are bound, and by which we are carryed farre from God. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.2. It is that by which we ceaſe fighting againſt Satan, and throwing away our weapons of defence and offence, we even fly into his Campe. So that Sin in divers reſpects doth worke the divers degrees of our Miſery. And this the Scripture teaches plentifully. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>And that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we can do nothing but Sinne. Ier.</hi> 13.23. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.21.</p>
               <p>So that, by Sin men are made the Divels Captives, and we muſt know, that men are not judged what they are, by their ſtock, whence they are borne, nor by the place, wherein they live; nor by the like circumſtances, but by their ſtudies and actions, as if one an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man by Nation, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by birth, a Courtier; yet in mind and heart be wholly a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> bewraying our Counſels to them, and helping theirs; whoſe Servant would ſuch a one be counted, ſure not of our Prince; but even a ſecret and cloſe factor and Servant of <hi>Spayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is with us, it little availes to be borne in the Church, or of Chriſtian Parents, to profeſſe Religion, to be preſent at the Word and Sacraments, if our wils doe ſerve the Divell.</p>

And ſhall we ſo much eſteeme the liberty of the Body, and neglect it for the Soule, which is ſo much the more excellent, by how much the Soule excels the body. What do we then by Sinning? Surely this, we caſt away our Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aegypt</hi> was a figure of Hell, <hi>Pharoah</hi> of the Divell. The yron Furnace of death, the Clay, workes of Sin; whereby Satan holds us bound. Now how were they delivered? Sure by Chriſt alone, and that by his Bloud, and that war figured two wayes. Firſt, the Paſchall Lamb was to be ſlain, with the bloud whereof, the doore-poſts were to be ſprinkled and ſo free from the deſtroying Angell. This was a Figure of Chriſt, who by his Bloud ſhed, deſtroyed the firſt borne of death, even by his power and ſtrength; and this was the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our Redemption. The ſecond degree and abſolute, was the Drowning of them all in the Red Sea.</p>
               <p>Now that was a figure of Chriſt, which did open the way of ſafety to the <hi>Jſraelites,</hi> and brought utter deſtruction to the enemies. So that we ſee a double Deliverance in this ſhadow; firſt a Killing of the chief ſtrength and darlings of the enemies, but yet not a freedome from the purſuing of the enemies. The ſecond was, wherein all Periſhed, not one eſcaped. So it is with us, The ſprinkling of the bloud of Chriſt hath cut the nerves of Satan and Hell. But when by Death wee ſhall bee drenched into the Sea of his bloud, we ſhall be free from all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of enemies.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Type was in <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> whoſe Victories were lively ſhadowes of Chriſt. For as by the blowing of Rammes hornes, the Wals of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell; ſo by the Preaching of the death of Chriſt, the horne of Chriſt, the Ramme Sacrificed, being blown, it cauſed the pillars of Satans Kingdome to ſhake, and the doores to open.</p>

               <p>By the <hi>Broken heart,</hi> is not meant a heart lightly bruiſed, or ſomewhat broken; but a heart broken into the ſmalleſt pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as Corne is broken twixt the Milſtones, or as any thing is beaten to powder in a Morter.

               </p>
               <p>Seeing <hi>Chriſt cures ſuch onely,</hi> it much concernes us to ſtirre up this ſenſe of Sin in us, and to avoid all ſuch things, whereby it may be deaded and wee lulled aſleep; and to this end Chriſt diligently warnes us of two things. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34.

For how can any Godly ſorrow take place amidſt all voluptuous delights; the like is ſhewed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.4, 5, 6, 7, 11 verſes. For when day and night is ſpent in deviſing and muſing of outward and Carnall pleaſures, what roome is left for holy Meditations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations and conſiderations, which was the meanes that made <hi>David</hi> turne to Gods teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>So that if we regard our Soules health, wee muſt avoid the exceſſe of Carnall delights, and thinke it much better to ſorrow heere a while, and to be comforted hereafter; then for tranſitory delight to incurre Eternall torment. So for the ſecond, the cares of this World is a manifeſt hinderer, for they choke the Word, it cannot have it perfit worke; this is ſeen in <hi>Dives;</hi> this is ſeene <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18.

This Blindneſſe conſiſts chiefly in three things: Firſt, in a want and inability of ſaving Knowledge in things Spirituall; Secondly, in the not knowing our Miſery the filthineſſe of Sin, the horrour of Eternall death and wrath of God; Thirdly, the ignorance of the Remedy of all theſe.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſayd, that theſe (happily) may bee true, of <hi>Pagans</hi> and ſuch as are out of the Church; but all that are in the Church, taught by the word of God, they know and can ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>To this, it may be anſwered, That the knowledge of all men ſticking in the dregs and myre of Nature, is meere Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and farre differing from that, the Regenerate have, as

But if on the ſuddaine, his eyes ſhould be opened; ſuch an inexpected ſhape and ſhew of things wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Euen the like difference is 'twixt the knowledge of a Naturall man and one renewed, for the one ſees Sin naked in his lively colours, and abhorres from his heart the filthineſſe of it: But the other ſees it a farre off, and through a falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull glaſſe of pleaſure or profit, whence followes a deſire of committing ſin. And as a Drunken man is not altogether blind, but ſees thoſe things before his feet, and yet, one while knock his face againſt this Wall, another while, ſtumbles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſtone and yet feeles no paine of this hurt, till he hath ſlept out his Surfets.</p>
               <p>So the Naturall man being drunk with Pleaſures, daſhes his face againſt this Sin, his foot againſt another, continually ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and falling into ſome ditch, and never grieves for all theſe, but even as the Drunkard is ſtill a thirſt, hee deſires more; ſo theſe, run moſt greedily after Sin.

               <p>And that we may grow into a more earneſt hatred of Sin, let us a little conſider the Miſery of this Captivity: there are ſome kind of ſervitudes, that have ſome refreſhing and eaſe, as ſuch as are borne Servants or bought do find either through a meekeneſſe of their Maſters nature, or through their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to pleaſe, receives ſome kind uſage, and recompence, or protection; as we have examples in Scripture.

But we while we are Captives to Satan, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of comming thence, and of ever ſatisfying our cruell Tyrant, or of being benefited by him. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was not urged to forſake his Religion, but this is all the intent of Satan, thereby to make us as odious to God as himſelf, and to make us ſtinke in Gods noſtrils: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in ſore bondage in broyling in the fiery furnace, in being tyed to a taske impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in being beaten, in having their firſt borne murthered. Yet all theſe were but outward miſeries and bodily, and ſome comfort was in it, that theſe things were exacted of them, not to much to reproach or diſgrace them, as to ſatisfie the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of the Prince. But our Captivity is both of body

It may ſeeme that God of purpoſe did not appoint any ſhort time for this Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, but to have extended the ſpace of it, as farre almoſt as the bounds of Mans life. To this end (as may probably bee conjectured) that wee might underſtand, that this happie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate cannot be attained, but wee muſt paſſe through many troubles before; and God would not put a further diſtance of ſpace, leaſt men ſhould diſpaire the living ſo long as to bee partaker of the Ioy thereof. Thus in wiſdome, with reſpect to us, the Lord doth vouchſafe to diſpoſe of things.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond thing. The <hi>Name,</hi> it was ſo called of the Rams-hornes, whereof the Trumpets were made, wherewith that Feaſt was proclaimed and publiſhed, the Tenth day of the ſeaven Moneth, which was called <hi>the Feaſt of Expiation.</hi> Now this was a lively Figure of <hi>Chriſts death;</hi> for thoſe Trumpets were of Rams-hornes, and there the Feaſt had the name: Which argues, it was for ſome ſpeciall reaſon, and it is this, That <hi>the Death of Christ,</hi> was figured thereby; for Trumpets were made of the <hi>Ramme</hi> ſacrificed. So by the Power and joyfull voyce of Chriſts death, <hi>Reconciliation was brought to the people.</hi> 3. For the <hi>Priviledges.</hi> They are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Bookes, by all which it is manifeſt, That this Yeare was a lively repreſentation of the Life to come; for all theſe things are there fully accompliſhed: And the Goſpell was alſo figured, as that whereby all theſe were begun in the

               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Blind</hi> know not whither to goe, or which way to turne them.

The Apoſtle therefore makes this the drift of his Epiſtle, to incourage and inſtruct the faithfull how to fight for the maintenance of the Truth of the Goſpell <hi>the Doctrine of Faith,</hi> leaſt by hearing wretched men, they be caſt from their ſtation; and that this exhortation might have more force with them, he uſes a moſt forceable reaſon after this manner. From what thing there is great danger leaſt we ſhould ſwerve, and from which to ſwerve is a moſt grievous Sin; for that thing, every one muſt earneſtly contend. But there is great danger of falling from the Faith, and a grievous Sin it is, procuring fearfull Puniſhments; and therefore it is moſt neceſſary to ſee to this. The firſt part of the reaſon being plain, and ſuch as will be confeſſed, he confirmes the ſecond part; firſt of all, ſhewing the danger in the fourth <hi>verſe.</hi> That the Enemies of the Truth are ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Second, hee ſhewes in 5, 6 and 7 verſes, How hainouſly God took at any time the defection from the Truth and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sin by wofull and evident examples; as of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, of the Angels that kept not their firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> in that they regarded not the admonition of <hi>Lot.</hi> Now becauſe men are more ſenſible of the grievous puniſhments of Defection, then they are of the danger of Falling, <hi>Fearing more the puniſhment, then Sinne the cauſe.</hi> Therefore, the Apoſtle puls back his foot againe, and betakes himſelfe to a more lively and large demonſtration of the danger. And therefore from the 8 verſe to the 20. Doth ſet downe, a moſt full deſcription of the wicked, the ſhew whereof and kinds are painted forth ſo terribly, that worthily it may awake any to circumſpection, what theſe men ſpeakes, what they meditate, and what miſchief they nouriſh in their ſecret hearts, he brings forth to light; and all theſe things are done ſo plainly and particularly, that none can but marvaile at, as well the diligence of the Holy Spirit, as his care of us, in that he hath ſo marked and branded theſe wicked men in the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114018:52"/> fore-heads, that every one might know them and avoid them. And that none might wonder that ſuch ſwarmes of wicked men ſhould ariſe at the light of the Goſpell, he ſhewes that this was no other thing then ſuch as was long ſince fore-told by <hi>Enoch</hi> of theſe laſt Times, and lately alſo by ſome of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Apoſtles, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter.</hi> So then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe both of the danger from theſe evill men, as alſo of the Sin of defection being opened ſufficiently in this 20 verſe and following, he concludes his Exhortation: but the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is not expreſſed in ſo many words, to wit, <hi>That they muſt fight,</hi> but in the roome thereof, it is declared, by what meanes and after what manner the faithfull muſt contend. For in vaine might one diſcover a danger, unleſſe ſome meanes be preſcribed for the avoiding of it. He therefore ſhewes that the faithfull muſt contend both for themſelves and for others. For themſelves in the 20, and 21, verſes; and for others their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, verſes 22, 23. Whereas they are not in a like danger or fault; therefore to ſome, one kind of meanes muſt be uſed, for they that are fallen by Infirmity, muſt be reſtored by <hi>the Spirit of Lenity.

But they that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed themſelves into their Enemies hands, and drawn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they muſt be brought home againe <hi>with Terrour and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,</hi> by ſhewing them their dangerous eſtate wherein they ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For themſelves.</hi> The way of ſafegarding themſelves, is by the diligent practice of one chiefe thing, they muſt keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the <hi>Love of God.</hi> And fence themſelves with it as with a Trench, but to the making of this fence, they need three things, as three ditches or bankes (to wit,) Faith, Prayer, &amp; Hope. Briefly. There are foure things commended to every Chriſtian, whereby he may defend himſelfe againſt the force of the wicked. (to wit.) <hi>Faith, Prayer, Love of God, &amp; Hope.</hi> Now let us ſpeake of each particular in a word firſt admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that this care ought not leſſe to touch us, then thoſe ancient Chriſtians to whom <hi>Iude</hi> wrote, Yea, it much more concernes us, diligently to provide for our ſelves, leaſt our Faith being vanquiſhed, wee be brought into bondage, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114018:52"/> deſtruction, wee being in as great danger as ever were any. For we ſee (Reverend Fathers,) into what times and manners we are fallen; for although at the mention of ſo great Impiety as the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of, <hi>There is none but doth feare and tremble,</hi> yet theſe are the times wherein Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>That Iniquity ſhould abound, the Charity of many wax cold, and in which the Son of man, when he came to judgement, ſhould ſcarce find Faith in the Eath.</hi> The Apoſtles time was the beſt, and as the Spring time, fit to grow and increaſe the Church; but theſe our times, are Autumnall, fit for gathering fruits, which if they be not reaped in their due time, do grow fluſh and wither through too much ripeneſſe, and go backward, while at laſt, the graine or Seed being ſhaken and fallen to the earth, there remaines nothing but empty blades.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, that the horrible Impietie of <hi>Popery,</hi> is by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God (bleſſed be his Name) long ſince baniſhed, our Church with the neighbour Countries are illuſtrated with the beames of the truth. Yet there doth ſlyly creepe ſome ſecret and lurking evill, in the wrapping it ſelf in the cloke of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which doth weaken all the ſtrength of Religion: Wee will all be called Chriſtians, and all profeſſe we know the true God. But who almoſt denies him not with his deeds. Wee all make a ſhew of Piety; What? Did I ſay All. I would it could truly be ſo ſaid. For many do ſo hate the ſemblance of Piety, that they abhorre from all ſhew of honeſty.</p>
               <p>But be it, that all profeſſe Piety, but how few make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any Sin; Yea, who is it not almoſt, that under this name of Religion, thinkes not that all liberty is granted to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy luſts. So that although theſe times have whereof they may boaſt, (if they knew to uſe the good given them) yet it is come to that diſſolute negligence in all Piety, that there is none but can witneſſe that to be true, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles once foretold of the miſeries of the Times. Wherefore, ſeeing Iniquity, the floud gates being ſet open, doth poure forth it ſelf into our Age; let us thinke that this exhortation of the Apoſtle doth meerely concerne us. And let us be armed and prepare our ſelves to the battle, and let us diligently attend <hi>The Precept
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114018:53"/> of the Spirit,</hi> that we may be found worthy to eſcape theſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy times. And now let us come to the firſt particular propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſuccour of preſerving the love of God in us, is <hi>Faith it ſelf.</hi> For this only certainly knowes, that we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour, <hi>Through the al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>otted out, it knowes that nothing can befall us, which is not a furtherance to good. Wherefore it muſt needs be, that while this ſhall remaine in our hearts, it will m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke the greatneſſe of Gods love to us, moſt cleere and ſure. And not this only but it doth alſo ſo vehemently enflame us to a <hi>mutuall love,</hi> that we ſhall deſire to ſhew our ſelves thankfull by all meanes; The Woman that had many Sinnes forgiven <hi>Loved much;</hi> and the debter, <hi>Loves much,</hi> whoſe debt forgiven was the greateſt. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.19. We <hi>Love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us ſee the <hi>Precept it ſelf.</hi> This Faith is declared in this place by a two-fold argument. Firſt from the adjoynt of Holineſſe called <hi>a Holy Faith;</hi> becauſe this alone doth teach us to thinke holily of God and to conceive honourably of him. It doth purge the heart and endue and ſeaſon it with true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. The ſecond thing by which Faith is here deſcribed, is the ſubject <hi>Our,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith of all the faithfull; for the Apoſtle doth not exhort Chriſtians to build themſelves of another Faith, whereof themſelves have either none or a very ſlender notion; but by this ſpeech, he doth warne that no man privately coyne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a new Faith, deviſed from that, the holy Scriptures would have one and common to all. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> cals the ſame Faith a <hi>common Faith,</hi> as <hi>Iude</hi> did a <hi>common Salvation. Tit.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. chap. 1, verſe. The thing exhorted to be pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>formed touching this Faith, is noted in this word <hi>Build up;</hi> which is a figur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tive ſpeech taken from Architectors or Maſons; for as that they build not on one ſide or other beſides the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion layd; but doth reare their building, juſt and ſtraight on the ground-worke, and after the worke once begun, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intermit their labour, till they have finiſhed the juſt buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114018:53"/> So if we deſire to beare the force and aſſaults of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, it behoves us that our ſelves, and all our actions, thoughts, and words, be laid on no other, then the ſole foundation of <hi>Faith,</hi> and that wee never give over ſo doing till wee have brought our worke to ſome perfection. So that two things are heere commanded. Firſt, that whatſoever wee doe, we referre it to <hi>Faith</hi> as to the ſquare thereof. Second, that we labour daily to increaſe in <hi>Faith.</hi>

               <p>
                  <label>What Faith is.</label> That <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby all our actions and counſels muſt bee ordered, (as farre as I can judge) is not only a certaine and ſtedfaſt manner and knowledge of things to be done, and not to be done, (for why ſhould this be called moſt Holy) neither is this certain perſwaſion, common to all Chriſtians. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereby is meant that <hi>juſtifying Faith, whereby we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded and aſſured, that our ſelves with all ours, are acceptable to God through Chriſt, with the object and ground of this Faith, to wit, the Goſpell and Promiſes of God.</hi> For though wee were moſt certaine, that that we doe is lawfull and expedient, yet unleſſe it come from this Faith, it is ſin and cannot pleaſe God. For, <hi>ſuch workes as cannot expect God a rewarder of them by his Promiſe, ſuch as are all thoſe, that are done without this Faith,</hi> though they be moſt glorious outwardly, yet they cannot ſtand before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may be asked, how then muſt this be done, that all our actions may be grounded on Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this anſwer is made, that <hi>Paul</hi> teaches this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12, and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>What ever you doe, do all to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it be demanded, how all things may be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>

               <p>The like direction St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>So walke in Chriſt, rooted, and built and ſtabliſhed in the Faith.</hi> Sure a moſt godly and wholſome Precept; For if the ſenſe of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did alwayes dwell in our hearts, and that we would examine all our thoughts, ſayings, and deeds thereby, as by a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths Scales, what diſhoneſt things would at any time bee undertaken of us; or if it were begun, would not ſoone be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with many Teares. <hi>Eſra.</hi> 9.13, 14. Who would not accuſe himſelfe ſinning, and ſecretly reprove himſelf after this manner. Is this my wicked thought, ſaying, or deed, worthy and beſeeming him, all whoſe ſins God hath pardoned in Chriſt, whom he hath drawn out of the jawes of Death, whom he hath adopted for his Son and heire of everlaſting life? Shall I ſhew my ſelfe thus thankfull for all his benefits. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Yea rather O God! Seeing my goodneſſe extends not to thee.</hi> Pſa. 16. <hi>I will take the cup of Salvation and give thankes, I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire thy goodneſſe, ſaying. Lord what is man.</hi> Pſal. 144.2, 3. Thus if we would ſquare all our projects according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell apprehended by Faith, we ſhould not build Hey, &amp; Stubble, but Silver and Gold: And thus much of the firſt Point, of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying all our actions to the rule of Faith. Now it followes, how we may apply it to increaſe our Faith.</p>
               <p>There are divers degrees of Faith. <hi>There is a little Faith.</hi> Math. 8.26. <hi>There is a great Faith.</hi> Math. 15.28. <hi>There is a fulneſſe of Faith</hi> (Rom. 4.21.) of <hi>Abraham who was fully perſwaded and aſſured;</hi> and then <hi>the mind and heart of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is like to a Ship carryed with a full ſayle.</hi> Heb. 10.22. Yet this is not meant, that the Faith of the beſt is perfit in it ſelfe, but reſpectively in compariſon of thoſe that are weaker. Hence (1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.14, 15.) divers names of ages are given to Faith. For it hath its Maturity. I write to you <hi>Fathers,</hi> that is, to you which have long beleeved and increaſed in Faith. Faith hath its youth, I write to you <hi>young men,</hi> It hath its Infancy. I write to you <hi>Children and Babes.</hi> For theſe ages St. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually underſtand for the meaſure of the knowledge of Chriſt, and for the time which they had for the getting thereof. <hi>Mark.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:114018:54"/> 4.28. <hi>Our hearts when they have received the ſeed of the Word, are compared to the Earth, which firſt brings forth the Graſſe, then the ſtalke, then the fruit in the ſtalke, noting the increaſe of Faith and Grace.</hi> Which alſo is done in the Parable of the <hi>Muſtard-ſeed and of the Leaven.</hi> Math. 13, And the Goſpel doth acknowledge no other righteouſneſſe for Salvation, then that which is of Faith to Faith, that is, from a leſſer degree to a greater.</p>
               <p>So that, let this be the Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> That Faith as ſoone as it is caſt into the heart, is not ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfit; but as ſeed hath its daily increaſing, Hence (2 Theſ. 1. chap. 3.) Paul <hi>praiſes God and commends the Theſſalonians for increaſing in Faith.</hi> And yet further exhorts them to it. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1, 2. And <hi>Paul</hi> though he commend and that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Faith of the Romaines. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. Yet he deſires to ſee them to ſtrengthen them, and exhorts them to go on. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14.</p>
               <p>So then hence it followes, that every one muſt carefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that his weake Faith may be increaſed, and that he grow on forward to Grace. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets himſelfe for a preſident. <hi>Solomon</hi> avouches, that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man mounts in increaſe of Righteouſneſſe, as the Sun doth till it come to his full height. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. There is ſhewed that it was a chief end of Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Heaven, to furniſh his Church with ſuch gifts, as that every member might attaine his due proportion, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhewes, that all the Faitfull are as living Stones, which daily doe increaſe. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Whoſoever therfore he be whither No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Ignoble learned or unlearned, unleſſe he be a living ſtone, he is not a Stone of this building</hi> For as S. <hi>Pet.</hi> teaches. 2 Ep. 1.6, 7 v. <hi>Vnleſſe there be a joyning of one Grace to another, Chriſtians will be idle and unprofitable in the knowledge of Chriſt;</hi> hence on the one ſide are thoſe ſerious exhortations. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>To grow up to perfit Sanctification.</hi> And on the other ſide, ſharpe reproofe of thoſe, who decay in Grace. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.4, 5. How great force then ſhould theſe things have, to ſtirre
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114018:55"/> up our dead minds, and to give our utmoſt endeavour to this end. What? Shall we play the men in our youth and firſt times, and become children and weaklings when we have been long fed.</p>
               <p>Every thing moves ſwifter neerer the Center. Doe we not ſee, how in all things which are not perfited in their birth, what care and diligence both in Art and Nature are uſed, to finiſh the ſame. What paines do the beaſts take to perfit and nouriſh their young, the Husband-man diligently covers the Graine in the Earth, breaks Clods, drawes Furrowes, Weed and drive away all deſtroying Beaſts. And no leſſe care is in any other Trade, whither Marchandize or Mechanicall.</p>
               <p>When as therefore, there is the ſame nature and condition of our Faith, ſhall not we apply all our care hereunto, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord ſo encouraging us, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given, and to him that hath not ſhall be taken away.</hi> Luke 8.18. Mark. 4.24. <hi>With what meaſure you meet, &amp;c.</hi> That is, according to our diligence and ſincerity in the uſe of the meanes, ſuch will bee the meaſure of the Lords bleſſing for increaſe. If wee Heare, Reade, Pray, ſeldome and coldly, our increaſe will be ſlender as he that ſowes ſparingly ſhall ſo reap.</p>
               <p>But alas, in what things do men Macerate themſelves with cares, paines, watchings, but in ſuch things as are fraile, ſhort and unprofitable, from which Chriſt earneſtly diſwades. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.27, 28. But Faith is not deare to the World, though it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone free us from the ſlavery of Satan, and makes us the Sons of God, ſets us at liberty, this opens heaven to us, that was ſhut. Yea it repreſents it to us in this life, and gives us both a pledge and taſt of it.</p>

                  </label> Let us not content our ſelves with a bare name of Faith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us thinke it ſufficient, to have our minds brightned with any manner of knowledge as with Lightning, but if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, we have felt the lively heate thereof in our hearts, let us cheriſh, and adde new matter to it, that it may flame forth.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon, why, when we profeſſe the true God,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114018:55"/> true Chriſt, and ſincere Religion; Yet all this our knowledge and profeſſion is idle and unfruitfull. Many regard not Faith at all, others content themſelves with a name or Vizard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that true Religion doth abound with no leſſe ſwarmes of wicked men, then once the horrible Popiſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>

               <p>So the Popiſh Superſtition was only a Picture and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of Religion, the worke of mens hands, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> and therefore farre inferiour to our ſolid and ſubſtantiall Portraiture which God himſelfe hath faſhioned with his own hands, and doth exceed the other in Beauty and Truth of all the Members: But when as by our careleſneſſe, wee doe deprive Religion given us of God, of the life and Soule thereof; this our Carkaſſe which we ſcarce hold is no more availeable to performe the Office of a Chriſtian, then that Antichriſtian imitation of the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (my Brethren) if there be any care of freeing the Church of God, (the deere Spouſe of Chriſt,) from thoſe opprobies and imputations, wherewith for our ſakes, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly charged of the Adverſary, if we deſire to prove to our ſelves, that our Faith hath taken deeper roote, then that ever it ſhould wither away with the heat of the Sunne, if we deſire any comfort in adverſity and in the houre of death, let us apply our ſelves to increaſe and cheriſh Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, what meanes doſt thou ſhew us of doing this.</p>

                  </label> Let us practice theſe two, as is exhorted <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. Let us take heed of diſcouraging any in good, of giving evill example, of exhorting to ungodlineſſe. Alas then, it is eaſie to ſee why ſo little Faith appeares, why it decayes; becauſe Prophecying decayes, and men grow weary of it. Chriſtian admonition is intollerable. What greater policy can be of the Divell, then to ſtop the breath of Faith, and to dry up the breaſts thereof. As therefore we deſire the preſerving and increaſe of Faith, let us make much of the meanes, this will ſoften the heart; for as Graine cannot grow, if the ground be not moiſtened continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſo our hearts grow ſo hard that good things cannot thrive; and eſpecially this burden lies on thoſe, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> who are as common builders of others Faith, that they doe it willingly, and to this end, That ſuch as be ſet in ſuch places, bee kept to their taskes.</p>
               <p>How can a building go forward, if ſome builders build, and the others loyter, and who ſees not the neceſſity of this; how can a Souldier eſcape unwounded without his Shield of Faith, this is that alſo, that ſets the edge on the Sword of Faith, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo the Breaſt-plate. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>For even all the parts of the Chriſtian.

               <p>And that is <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is as a certaine Embaſſage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we entreat for Raine, Aſſiſtance; for Faith, Hope, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are by the gift of God, made as it were our houſhold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but ſo great is our wickedneſſe, that unleſſe a new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply be duly levyed out for us daily, to the oppoſing the ſame,

Wherefore, the Holy Ghoſt would not have us truſt too much to our naturall ſtrength, but to place all hope of Victory in forraine ayd. The <hi>Faithfull can do all things, but it is in Chriſt ſtrengthening them.</hi> Phil. 4.13. Whence St. <hi>Paul Epheſ.</hi> 6.

Let us then ſee how we may receive ſome bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and uſe of this ſuccour. This the Apoſtle ſhewes in a word, adding this, <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is, by the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this, anſwer is made. <label>What true Prayer is.</label> 
                  <hi>It is to call on God in true Faith by Christ, for things neceſſary according to the will of God;</hi> and all this, with a certaine divine and heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion or ſtirring of the Mind, whither through ſorrow for the feeling of our own wants, or of joy through the ſenſe of Gods favour. In this manner calling on God, we may be ſaid to Pray in the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe the Spirit doth ſtirre up in our minds all theſe things.</p>
               <p>For we of our ſelves (ſuch is our Ignorance and blindneſſe) know not altogether what we ſhould Pray for as we ought; and therefore the Spirit doth help this infirmity, and doth teach us being in a ſtreit, what we ſhould aske; and not this only, but when as a wonderfull blockiſhneſſe of heart doth wholly poſſeſſe us, the ſame Spirit doth mollifie our hard hearts, and doth infuſe ſuch lively heat into our minds, whereby we tremble at our own unworthineſſe, and rejoyce in the moſt acceptable mercy of God.

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But why doth the Apoſtle, preſently after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to maintaine Faith, adjoyne the Invocation of the Spirit. Doth not the mention of the Holy Spirit ſeeme altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114018:57"/> ſuperfluous in this place. For all Beleevers together with Faith, receive the Spirit; neither doth he leave them, who have once received him. So that the Faithfull whenſoever they Pray, do it by the Spirit.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I anſwer, that this is farre otherwiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſingular purpoſe, the Apoſtle admoniſhes them, that they doe not onely Pray, but they do it in the Spirit. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54. How ready were <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> to aske of God that <hi>fire might come down, &amp;c.</hi> But Chriſt reproved them, telling them they knew not what Spirit they were of. <hi>For they Prayed not with the Holy Spirit, but from the Fleſh, or the Spirit of Pride, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and revenge.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.40. When Chriſt had taught his Diſciples what they ſhould Pray, and yet they being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the heat and earneſtneſſe of the Spirit, knew not how to Pray, this thing Chriſt had commanded them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in verſe 45. Chriſt found them on ſleep, in his greateſt extremity they could not watch one houre. <hi>Iames</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>Yee obtaine not, becauſe yee aske not, yee aske and have not, becauſe yee aske amiſſe.</hi> By all this it is apparent, that the Faithfull themſelves, who have taſted of true Faith, and have received the firſt fruits of the Spirit, do oft by negligence fall into ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that either a long while they intermit the duty of Prayer, or their Tongue is divided from their Hearts, and performe it ſo coldly, that if God did not pardon the ſame unto them they ſhould undergoe ſome heavy judgement for their negligent wantonneſſe, wherefore we are admoniſhed of two things in this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the firſt.</p>
               <p>This is fitly adjoyned to the former, for Prayer is the breath of Faith, and while Faith lives it cannot but breath this breath. For he that feeles his owne wants (as Faith teaches it) and know, that the way to ſpeed is Begging, and is alſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the love and favour of God, how can he but Pray, Who would not aske a thing h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>God doth plentifully afford to us Manna and Partridges, but doth not God withall, ſend leanneſſe into our Soules; when as God hath contracted and drawn in to himſelfe, his ſaving Arme, and hath broken the ſtaffe of his heavenly Bread.

               <p>The other caution is, that we Pray by the Spirit; that we offer not the Sacrafice of fooles. For it is not enough, to right Praying, that one perſwade himſelfe that he is Faithfull, but

               <p>Let us then (my Brethren) looke well to our Hearts and Lipps when wee come before God to aske, that we utter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what comes out of a lively ſenſe of the heart, and a high eſtimation of the worth of the Grace required, both which proceed from the Spirit. Take heed that when our Hearts ſhould be lifted up, it be not preſſed down with ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when our Faith ſhould bee carryed in the Barke of a good Conſcience, that we make not the leaſt leake in it. For how can wee aske or intreat for that, which our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tels us, we can have no hope to receive it, preferring more Inditements and accuſations againſt us, then wee can utter petitions with our mouths for our ſelves. And thus much of the ſecond duty commended to a Chriſtian as a ſuccour, both of his Faith, before mentioned; as alſo of the principall thing exhorted unto in the words following.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:114018:58"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And keepe your ſelves in the Love of God.]</hi> This is the chief thing aymed at, to the which all the other things do ſerve. To wit, Faith, Prayer, and Hope.</p>
               <p>The Love of God may be, yea is taken two wayes in the Scripture. Firſt paſſively, for that whereby we are beloved of God, or Gods love to us. And this is that ſo frequent in the Scripture. Second, it is taken actively, for the love wherewith we love God. If we referre this precept, to the former kind of love, how can we preſerve our ſelves in the ſame; for wee can neither procure the love of God toward us, by any merits; nor preſerve the continuance of it.</p>
               <p>But to reſolve this doubt, we muſt underſtand that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive love of God is taken two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the love wherewith he loved us, before we were borne, or the World was made. This love is wholly gratuitall. neither did the Lord find any thing in us, by which he ſhould be ſwayed with the leaſt inclination of love to us, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4.10. Yea there was in us contrary matter of hatred. And this love in it ſelf is never interrupted, never increaſed or diminiſhed, but is one and the ſame, conſtant and equall. And of this Love of God as it is in God, the Apoſtle gives not charge here, for wee have no part or act in this, that we can preſerve it.</p>
               <p>Only touching this, we are willed, never to let goe the ſenſe of it out of our hearts, in which meaning the Apoſtle uſes the word <hi>Love, Rom.</hi> 8.35, 39. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Keepe your ſelves in the Love of God,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>and not keepe for your ſelves the Love of God.</hi> The other ſort or part of this paſſive love, is that, which is called actuall beneficence or bountifulneſſe, by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimye of the cauſe for the effect; that is, thoſe effects of love, and for thoſe kindneſſes wherewith lovers doe proſecute them they love.</p>
               <p>So that to this, are referred, firſt the will and pleaſure of doing good and then the actuall beneficence it ſelf. And this love of God is not alike towards all the Elect, but is greater towards theſe. That is, he doth beſtow greater benefits on thoſe, who have fully and wholly put off all corruption of Nature,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114018:59"/> ſuch as are the Saints in Heaven. On theſe I ſay, he beſtowes more, then he doth on thoſe Elect, which either lie ſtill in their ſins, as not yet called, or then he doth on thoſe, in whom the grace of Regeneration is begun; and yet he beſtowes more on theſe latter, then on the other; and ſo we may conclude that they are dearer to him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that Loveth me, ſhall be Loved of my Father, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein he doth ſhew, that he doth beſtow a greater meaſure of love on the Elect called, who now actually love Chriſt, then he doth on them that know him not.</p>
               <p>For God loves his own gifts, and the more they are, the more he loves, and the more lively Image of himſelf, he loves more then an obſcurer, To the ſame purpoſe are theſe words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> Whence it is apparent, that the more one loves God, and obſerves and keepes his word, he is the more beloved of God and Chriſt, and doth find the preſence, operation and abode of God and his Spirit, more effectuall and fruitfull in him, then they doe that do leſſe love him.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the Paſſive love of God, with the two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees thereof.</p>
               <p>The Active love of God, is that whereby we love God. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.5. <hi>If any keepe my word, truly the Love of God is perfit in him.</hi> That is, he ſhewes that he doth ſincerely love God, not in word, but in deed expreſſing it, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeakes of our love one towards another.</p>
               <p>Now to apply this diſtinction of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> If you aske whither of theſe two the Apoſtle meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Surely neither muſt be excluded, for though they are diſtinct, yet never ſevered; the laſt being an effect of the former, and a meaner to retaine the ſame; though it bee no cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Yet the Paſſive love of God muſt have the preheminence, and is chiefly meant, and as an argument that this is ſo, may be that Precept of Chriſt in the ſame words. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.9. <hi>Abide
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114018:59"/> in my Love,</hi> and the Apoſtle here may ſeeme not darkely to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude thither.</p>
               <p>And whereas this love of God was expreſſed in two degrees, this cannot ſo well be underſtood of the firſt degree, but onely of the ſenſe and feeling of that Eternall, immenſe, conſtant and moſt free love of God is alwayes to be cheriſhed in our hearts, and that by the bountifulneſſe and operative Love of God, which is as a ſpeciall meanes to Seale up in our Hearts the former.</p>
               <p>For this gratifying love of God, though it be alwayes gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itall, yet God would there ſhould be ſome part and duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Regenerate, which while he doth beſtow on us, as deſerving no ſuch thing, it might give us a taſte of that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden Love of God, and might perſwade us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and leane wholly on that.</p>
               <p>So that this Exhortation hath this meaning.</p>
               <p>Cheriſh in your Hearts (yee beloved) with all care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, the ſenſe of the Eternall Love of God, wherewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all beginning, he embraced you in Chriſt; and becauſe the Actuall and gratifying Love of God, whereby he doth dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow his benefits on Soule and Body, and is moſt availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to preſerve this ſenſe and feeling, we muſt give all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that wee may provoke the moſt bountifull liberality of God, towards us; eſpecially in things concerning our Soules and Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Now if you aske, how this may be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sure Chriſt hath given us a generall Rule. <hi>John</hi> 15.10.</p>
               <p>If we will keepe his commands, we ſhall abide in his Love, for to thoſe that do continue in the wayes of his Precepts, God doth daily give a more plentifull increaſe of the gifts of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby he doth make that his Eternall Love more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and witneſſed to our hearts.</p>
               <p>And hither belong theſe places above named, <hi>wherein God doth promiſe, that hee will familiarly converſe with thoſe that doe ſincerely love him, that he will fix his ſeat there, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

               </p>
               <p>And let us not thinke it in vaine, to ſerve God, and that there is no reward in keeping his command: For if all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantages faile, yet this doth not; an increaſe of Grace whereby is increaſed our aſſurance.

               <p>So that wee ſee by what meanes this ſenſe of Gods Love is brought into our Hearts even by the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>

               <p>But we ſhall not need to ſeeke other meanes for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this then thoſe the Apoſtle delivers in this place. For if there ſhall be a continuall Meditation of our Righteouſneſſe purchaſed by Chriſt, If there ſhall be a ſerious Meditation of thoſe good things, wherewith God rewards the Servant cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on his name, If alſo our hearts ſhall be throughly enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a conſtant expectation of that felicity laid up in Heaven for the Faithfull: What can be wanting to us, for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114018:60"/> the preſerving a lively ſenſe of this Love we ſpeake of. See how loftily the Apoſtle vaunted himſelfe in the confidence of never looſing the ſenſe of this Love, bearing himſelfe only on theſe grounds and props. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall ſeperate us from the love of God in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what can be more renowned and Honourable, what more to be deſired, then that fraile and weake man ſhould bee ſtronger and more powerfull, then Life, then Death, then the Divel, then Sin and all the terrours of Hell; and yet St, <hi>Paul</hi> doth witneſſe that the ſenſe of this Love alone did put this Noble heart and Victorious Spirit into him. And every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, truely fearing God, hath experience of this in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>This is, that admirable and wonderfull power, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries men violently through glory and Ignominy, through good report and bad, through fire and torments, that they might Magnify the name of their God, whoſe unſpeakable love they feele in their hearts. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The Love of God conſtrains us.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>For when they have Gods favour, they ſtand not much on it, that the World is againſt them. For ſay, the wicked ſpoyle their goods, thirſt after their bloud; yet what need they bee diſcouraged in heart, when they know that theſe light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be recompenced with ſo great reward as is ſhewed, 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4.15.16, 17. <hi>Wherefore let us get to our ſelves, this moſt ſtrong Bulwarke againſt all the force of Satan and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents.</hi>

               <p>Let us endeavour to Sanctity, that being made richer in Graces, we may have a more plentifull aſſurance, and deeper ſtampe Imprinted in our hearts, which none hath ever taſted, or ſhall no not with the leaſt ſipping, that ſets not himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly to this taske, and makes Conſcience to proceed and increaſe in the ſame courſe, having a pure heart, a true tongue and clean hands.</p>
               <p>But alas, if theſe things be ſo, who can ſufficiently bewayle theſe our dayes, wherein men ſhew that they are ſo farre from
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114018:61"/> preſerving themſelves in the love of God, that they are ſet to caſt themſelves out of the ſame, while ſome ſeeke above all to preſerve themſelves in the love of the World, and ſo the love of God cannot be in them.

               <p>Others go on in the open breach of all Gods Lawes, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirit of God, provoking him to his face, and moving him to turne his Love into Anger.</p>
               <p>Is not the love of many waxed cold, and doth not the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this love in men, ſhew that God begins to withdraw his Love, which was the beginning of the other.</p>

               <p>Firſt, from a property or effect, namely. Wayting.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the object or thing wayted for, the Mercy of Chriſt, called the Grace of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. at the end, as alſo the fruit thereof, Eternall Life, which often is called Hope.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the end Eternall Life. So that the ſenſe of all is. <hi>Wayting for Eternall Life through the Mercy of Chriſt.</hi> Where at the firſt, is diſcovered that impudent deviſe and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Popiſh Church, touching their double juſtification, the firſt whereof they avouch to be of Grace; but that at leaſt of Grace and workes, whereas here it is expreſſed, <hi>That a Christian juſtified waytes for Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But leaving them to their blindneſſe, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> let us ſee what may concerne our ſelves</p>
               <p>This Wayting, here expreſſed, is a lively property of true Chriſtian Hope, in part, common to it with Faith. For Faith and Hope have both the ſame grounds, the ſame cauſes, the like effects; and therefore, as he that Beleeves makes not haſt, ſo neither doth he that Hopes.</p>
               <p>So that, <hi>To Hope, Waite, Expect and Truſt,</hi> are put all for one in the old Teſtament. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.40, 41. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the three common graces of a Chriſtian, the Apoſtle gives to each one their peculiar property or effect; giving to <hi>Faith</hi> a <hi>Worke,</hi> to <hi>Love Labour,</hi> and to <hi>Hope Patience.</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114018:62"/> And therefore it had <hi>need be of good Mettall and well tempered.</hi> Now the grounds of Chriſtian Hope are chiefly three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the merits of Chriſt, for as Faith beleeves juſtification and forgiveneſſe, ſo Hope beleeves (as I may ſay) Salvation and the poſſeſſion of the Inheritance. And in this regard,</hi> the Apoſtle hath conjoyned Faith and Hope in one common deſcription. <hi>For Chriſt as well purchaſed Heaven, as pardon of Sin, ſo that as Faith beleeves the one, ſo doth Hope the other;</hi> eſpecially, ſince Sin being taken away, nothing can debarre us Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 54 9, 10. Ier. 31.34, 35, 36, 37, verſes.</note>The ſecond ground of Hope is the <hi>Truth of Gods Promiſes, not only</hi> ſimply in themſelves, <hi>But confirmed with experience of accompliſhment of many paſt, concluding thence, that ſeeing the greateſt is accompliſhed, the leſſe will much more; eſpecially theſe Promiſes being ratified with an Oath.</hi> Heb. 6.16.</p>
               <p>The third ground, is the <hi>Pledge of the Spirit,</hi> the earneſt <hi>and firſt fruits and a Seale.</hi> Now any of theſe are ſufficient with men to put away doubting, much more with God.</p>
               <p>If Hope be not builded on theſe grounds as on a Rock, the Houſe will fall, as the Papiſts have given experience, when the Tempeſt hath come on them.</p>
               <p>So that hereby is overthrown both the Hope of the Papiſt, as alſo of the common people. For as it is in Faith, ſo with Hope in the Ideot. He hopes well, but gets naught, becauſe both his Faith and Hope are miſgrounded. Ariſing of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God and himſelf. While not knowing his deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved miſery and curſed corrupt eſtate, he takes himſelfe to bee wholly Gods workmanſhip, forgetting how the Divell by his finger hath marred the ſame. And ſo thinke that God cannot but love him, and accept his own handy worke, and if happily he know and in ſome ſort confeſſe this yet preſently all is ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with this, that God is mercifull, not thinking of his juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, without ſatisfaction whereof, there is no place for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>But whoſoever would not have his Hope deceive him, hee muſt have better grounds then this conceit; for as he that for ſome heynous offence is caſt in Priſon, and for the ſame,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114018:62"/> hath the ſentence of Death paſſed on him: Now for him to have not only a pardon for his offence, but alſo a great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue aſſigned him. He hath need to have all the Kings Seales and large Charters.</p>
               <p>Even ſo, muſt every true Chriſtian be able to ſhew his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don under the broad Seal of the Word and Bloud of Chriſt, and muſt alſo know the Conveyance, Title, Tenure of Heaven, and by what ſervice hee holds it, before hee can have an aſſured Hope, eſpecially there being great danger in miſtaking the Title; for if we claime Heaven any other way, then that by which it is offered unto us, we can never obtaine it. As the Apoſtle doth notably ſhew. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, true Chriſtian Hope doth qualifie a man and fit him that while hee holds this in Reverſion, hee may daily prepare himſelfe for it, againſt it fall; and therefore, look what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are injoyned on his part, he will be carefull to perform, and what the Word preſcribes to be in them that hope for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he doth demonſtrate to be in himſelf.

                  <hi>this is plainly taught in the example of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who forſooke his own Country, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon was, <hi>He looked for a City whoſe builder was God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.19.</note> The like of <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11.27. And this effect is notably taught, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. at the end. Where is ſhewed, that Hope is the Sacred Anchor that pierces in.</p>
               <p>For as in the ſtorme, if the Anchor bee ſo deeply pitched, that by the violence of the Tempeſt, it loſe not his hold; the Ship ſafely endures the ſame.</p>
               <p>So a Chriſtian man having this, is ſecured from Stormes and Raines, which the Divell and all his forces can raiſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Simile. </seg>
                  </label> Whereas we ſee many Chriſtians with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114018:63"/> light wind, ſo to be toſſed in the World as in the deep Sea, and float here and there.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon but that they want this Anchor, which being pitched in Heaven, they might ſtay themſelves till the Tyrannie was paſſed. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26.20. This is as a Pent-houſe to keep off the daſhes. And thus having caſt Anchor, let us apply this a little and ſo draw to ſhore.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> Seeing theſe things are ſo, it is neceſſary that every one have this Anchor ready, eſpecially in theſe troublous times, wherein it is not only hard, to hold on in an even courſe, but very difficult for a wiſe Pylot to eſcape the Rockes and Sands.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (my beloved) let us ſtrengthen our weake hands and weary knees, let us call back this Hope and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which may ſeeme to be almoſt baniſhed from among men.</p>
               <p>For why are the Profits of this life ſo greedily ſought after? why is there no end of heaping up wealth? what meane theſe common fraud and circumventions one of another? Whence is that luſt of ruling, every where; there being no care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thoſe over whom they are ſet? Why will many be Paſtors and will not feed their Sheepe? Why doe men at this day, meaſure the Truth, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> not in equity of Conſcience and ſincerity of judgement, out of the Word; but by their private profits? Why have men caſt off all care of ſeeking the Heavenly Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, not being heires of thoſe, who through Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience inherit the Promiſes.</p>
               <p>They heare and partly ſee, that the Godly are of all men, moſt miſerable, this Hope excepted; and they thinking this Hope to be a ſmall comfort and ſuccour againſt ſo great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, they choſe rather to imbrace things preſent, leaving Hope for Fooles as they thinke.</p>
               <p>But ſure it is not for true Chriſtians, ſo to lead their lives as they that have no Hope, not to be groveling on the Earth as Sons of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Wee are borne of God, and are Citizens of the Heavenly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114018:63"/> Inheritance, we are as ſtrangers, not Denizens? why ſhould wee bee curious or inquiſitive in a ſtrange Countrey? why do we imbrace the place of our Exile, as our home.</p>
               <p>But we whither we be called in the Morning or at Noone, into the Vineyard; let us labour ſtoutly, and let us looke for the penny at the end of the day. Neither will the Lord deferre our Hope long.</p>
               <p>For loe, He comes, and his reward is with him, and yet a little while, and the Lord will come and not ſtay. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. at the end.</p>
               <p>Our Fathers dyed in the Faith foure thouſand yeares ſince, and received not the Promiſes, but ſaluted them a farre off. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Our race that we have runne, is much ſhorter. It ſhall not need, that we ſhould lie ſo long in the duſt, before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be perfitly reſtored; and though it ſhould be long, yet our dayes are circumſcribed in the compaſſe of a few yeares.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If wee ſhall feed our ſelves with this Hope, ſurely wee ſhall abide in the Love of God, in all affliction. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. For this Hope will whet our deſire, and as a Wife looking for her Husband, doth prepare her ſelf, and will not be entangled in any buſineſſe, much leſſe ſet her affection on any other man.</p>
               <p>So the Faithfull Soule longing for Chriſt will diſpoſe it ſelf for this Hope, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> though it moderate the deſire as touching the time, yet it quenches not, nor ſnibs the earneſtneſſe thereof; but it cryes out, <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come quickly.</hi> For he ſhall appeare to all that look for him in Faith, to Salvation.</p>
               <p>But the to wicked. Woe to that day! when they ſhall fly to the Mountaines to fall on them, and the Rocks to hide them.
